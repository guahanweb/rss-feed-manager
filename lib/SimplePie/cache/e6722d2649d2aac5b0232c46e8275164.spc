<p>Reports of meteor sightings are coming into the American Meteor Society by the thousands. According to one of the latest reports posted at the American Meteor Society website, “Its been a busy week for the AMS as we are bombarded by fireball reports from all different parts of the country. The latest event took place over Alabama and Georgia last night September 28th 7:30 PM local time. Over 250 witnesses from Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Alabama and Georgia have reported the event so far. Below is a heat map of the witnesses who saw the event. Click the image below for the event detail page and witness reports.” <sub>[1]</sub></p>
<p>Exactly why these meteors are coming into the atmosphere at this time is unknown. NASA and NOAA have yet to publish any reports on this phenomenon, although they did confirm the September 10, 2013 meteor that streaked across the sky in Alabama in theguardian.com article ‘Meteor enters atmosphere over Alabama and disintegrates, says Nasa’.<b> </b>An excerpt from the article reads, “Officials at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville say a baseball-size fragment of a comet entered Earth&#8217;s atmosphere above Alabama at 8:18pm CDT Monday. Nasa officials say the meteor traveled at a speed of 76,000 mph. They say just three seconds after hitting the atmosphere, it disintegrated 25 miles above the central Alabama town of Woodstock, producing a flash of light. Nasa spokeswoman Janet Anderson says that because it penetrated so deep into Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, eyewitnesses heard sonic booms.” <sub>[2]</sub></p>

<p>One explanation of the increase in sighting is mentioned on the American Meteor Society website in the article ‘Meteor Activity Outlook for September 28 – October 4, 2013’ which explains, “The <b>September-October Lyncids (SOL)</b> are only well seen on 3 nights centered on September 29th. Maximum occurs on the 30th when the radiant is located at 07:24 (111) +47. This position lies in western Lynx, 12 degrees north of the second magnitude star known as Castor (Alpha Geminorum). This area of the sky is best placed in the sky during the last hour before dawn, when it lies highest above the horizon in a dark sky. Rates at maximum are expected to be near one shower member per hour as seen from the northern hemisphere. These meteors can be seen from the tropical southern hemisphere but rates would be less than one per hour. With an entry velocity of 67 km/sec., most activity from this radiant would be of swift speed.” <sub>[5]</sub></p>
<p>Earthsky.org posted an article by Deborah Byrd titled “U.S. sees another bright fireball on September 27’ which covers the meteor sightings in detail, which reads, “The American Meteor Society (AMS) has reported at least 373 reports of another bright fireball – a very bright meteor, likely a small chunk of natural incoming space debris – over the U.S. last night (September 27, 2013). These reports followed <a href="http://earthsky.org/space/over-400-reports-of-large-fireball-over-u-s-midwest-on-september-26-3013" target="_blank">a similar event over approximately the same area</a> the day before (September 26). The AMS called the coincidence of two bright fireballs, or bright meteors, spotted over approximately the same region on consecutive days “surprising.” Witnesses from Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, Wisconsin and West Virginia reported a bright light moving across the night sky on September 27 at around 11:33 p.m. local time, according to the AMS.” <sub>[6]</sub></p>

<p>Internet software pioneer John McAfee has announced that he will be launching a new company that will make the internet &#8220;impossible to hack&#8221; and says that he will be releasing a device that will prevent the NSA from Spying on you.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;My new technology is going to provide a new type of Internet, a decentralized, floating and moving Internet that is impossible to hack, impossible to penetrate and vastly superior in terms of its facility and neutrality. It solves all of our security concerns,&#8221;</em> McAfee said in a recent interview.[1]</p>
<p>This includes security concerns in relation to government spying.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;There will be no way (for the government) to tell who you are or where you are,&#8221;</em> he said in an onstage interview with moderator Dan Holden at the inaugural C2SV Technology Conference + Music Festival.  <em>&#8220;And if the U.S. government bans its sale, &#8220;I&#8217;ll sell it in England, Japan, the Third World. This is coming and cannot be stopped.&#8221;[2]</em></p>
<p> McAfee has given few other details on this project so far.</p>

<h6>By JG Vibes<br /> <a href="http://intellihub.com/2013/09/30/new-nsa-leaks-assassination-program-released/" target="_blank"><strong>Intellihub.com</strong></a><br />September 30, 2013</h6>
<p>Reporter Glenn Greenwald has been causing an uproar in the political establishment since he helped Edward Snowden release the NSA files, proving beyond any doubt that the <a href="http://intellihub.com/?s=nsa&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank"><strong>NSA</strong></a> is in fact spying on every single American, from street sweeper to senator.</p>
<p>Now an associate of Greenwald&#8217;s has announced that they two will be working on another NSA leak together, this one in relation to the secret assassination program run by the US government.</p>
<p>Associated Press reported that Jeremy Scahill, a contributor to The Nation magazine and the New York Times best-selling author of &#8220;Dirty Wars,&#8221; said he will be working with Glenn Greenwald, the Rio-based journalist who has written stories about U.S. surveillance programs based on documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The connections between war and surveillance are clear. I don&#8217;t want to give too much away but Glenn and I are working on a project right now that has at its center how the National Security Agency plays a significant, central role in the U.S. assassination program,&#8221;</em> said Scahill, speaking to moviegoers in Rio de Janeiro, where the documentary based on his book made its Latin American debut at the Rio Film Festival.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;There are so many stories that are yet to be published that we hope will produce `actionable intelligence,&#8217; or information that ordinary citizens across the world can use to try to fight for change, to try to confront those in power,&#8221;</em> said Scahill.[1]</p>
<p>Journalists like Greenwald and Scahill are creating a panic among the ruling elite, and there is no doubt that the recent NSA revelations are tied to the renewed attacks on alternative media.</p>
<p>In the video below Abby Martin talks to Larry King, host of RT’s Politicking, about his views on what journalism should be, and how they are different from what ‘Breaking the Set’ presents.</p>
<p>In the short interview Larry King laments the death of the mainstream media and complains that people have too many options in their news today.</p>
<p>He says that Glen Greenwald and Abby Martin are not journalists because they offer their opinions on government corruption. He also says that he has “never heard of a war on whistleblowers”.</p>

<p>As we reported last week hundreds of people were killed, and countless injured after a 7.8 magnitude <a href="http://intellihub.com/?s=earthquake&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank"><strong>earthquake</strong></a> hit Pakistan on Tuesday.  Aftershocks were felt all throughout the middle east, and the surface of the earth has been changed forever.  </p>
<p>A new island rose from the seabed just off the coast of <a href="http://intellihub.com/?s=pakistan&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank"><strong>Pakistan.</strong></a></p>
<div id="attachment_117731" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 562px"><a href="http://intellihub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/island2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-117731 " alt="island2" src="http://intellihub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/island2.jpg" width="552" height="368" /></a>

</div>
<p>According to RT The first image of the island was taken  by NASA’s Earth Observing-1 satellite on September 26, while the second snapshot shows the same bay on April 17 with water and no landmass around the coordinates that the new island now inhabits. </p>
<p><i>“The island is really just a big pile of mud from the seafloor that got pushed up. This area of the world seems to see so many of these features because the geology is correct for their formation. You need a shallow, buried layer of pressurized gas—methane, carbon dioxide, or something else—and fluids. When that layer becomes disturbed by seismic waves (like an earthquake), the gases and fluids become buoyant and rush to the surface, bringing the rock and mud with them,”</i> Bill Barnhart, a geologist at the US Geological Survey told NASA’s Earth Observatory.</p>

<p>In an age of lies and manipulation, a new era of media reporting has emerged, peeling back the fabric of and exposing the lies of the mainstream media. Citizen journalists, the alternative media, independent media, grassroots organizations and even social media networker&#8217;s have been engaged in giving real information to the public like never before.</p>
<p>November 16th, is a date that alternative media, truth-seekers, and people worldwide should take note of as the epic <em>March Against Mainstream Media</em><sub>[1] </sub>is set to take place. Planners of the event are expecting to see an enormous number of individuals march together in protest, culminating at the doorstep of major media moguls television, radio and internet across America. It is expected that the five major outlets &#8211; <em>ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN,</em> and <em>FOX</em> &#8211; will respond in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>by broadcasting the message of the protestors, but withholding critical information, or</li>
<li>by denying coverage of an obviously important event. Should this happen, alternative media outlets will be providing the coverage, exposing the mainstream media&#8217;s dishonest decision</li>
</ol>
<p>The major networks otherwise known as the &#8220;mainstream media&#8221; have been bought and paid for since their conception. Only a handful of corporations, 6-8, own all of the major networks.  Not surprisingly some of these corporations also have a stake in major perpetuate interests that involve public policy and law-making. The typical news viewer is unaware of the bias, outright lies and fabrication they have been subjected to their entire lies. All of the news channels have perpetuated out-right lies, staged news events, and of course misled the public on public information at one time or another.</p>
<p>The Gulf of Tonkin attack is what led America into the Vietnam War. This infamous event was pushed by the mainstream media and had Americans rally in support of the war. However, it has recently been admitted that the attack never even happened. This is just one example out of hundreds, if not thousands of false reported, misleading global news stories that have caused utter devastation and destruction to society.</p>
<p>The alternative media has grown from the ashes of the now exposed corporate media and is delivering more relevant, accurate, and up-to-date media than the mainstream could ever dream of. </p>
<p>On November 16, 2013 the Nation will witness first-hand exactly what they have missed for so long. The March against the mainstream media intends to put the final nail in the coffin corporate sponsored media propaganda.</p>

<p>Last week just blocks from the pentagon, two men wearing black clothes and ski masks stole keys to the DC metro system from a fire truck.  The robbery happened between 4:00AM and 4:30AM just blocks away from the <a href="http://intellihub.com/?s=pentagon&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank"><strong>pentagon</strong></a>, in one of the most secure and highly policed areas of the country.</p>
<p>According to <em>CNN</em> an on-board video-camera captured images of the thieves as they either approached or departed the truck, Arlington Police Department spokesman Dustin Sternbeck said.  Both Sternbeck and Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said numerous items were lifted, including the Metro keys. Both declined to say how many keys were taken, or what the keys opened.<sub>[1]</sub></p>
<p>Police have also refused to release any information on the robbery, and it is likely that no suspects will be found.</p>
<p id="paragraph6">Arlington County Fire Department released the following statement:</p>
<p id="paragraph7"><em>&#8220;Measures have been taken to prevent it from happening in the future. Details can not be released, for security reasons.&#8221;</em><sub>[2]</sub></p>
<p>Local authorities are downplaying the robbery and the possibility that it could be linked to a terrorist threat.  Police are saying that since multiple items were stolen, that the keys were not the target, however they are surely the most vital thing to be stolen.</p>

<p>A 12-year-old boy was suspended from a Rhode Island middle school after he brought a small gun key chain to school.</p>
<p>According to NBC10 Joseph Lyssikatos said the key chain was in his backpack at Alan Shawn Feinstein Middle School on Thursday when it fell out. A classmate picked it up and started showing it to other students.</p>
<p>A teacher confiscated it and before Joseph knew it, he was suspended.</p>
<p>The school also informed Joseph&#8217;s family that he would not be allowed to attend a class field trip to Salem at the end of the month.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s disgraceful because, OK, being suspended for three days, and this big punishment is enough for him mentally,&#8221; Bonanno said.</p>
<p>Said Joseph: &#8220;I&#8217;m missing the NECAP testing and I&#8217;m in advanced math so I&#8217;m going to have to re-do all the homework I&#8217;m going to miss for advanced math.&#8221;</p>
<p>School officials released a statement that said, &#8220;Because this is a student discipline issue, we cannot comment on any specifics.&#8221;</p>

<h6>Staff Writer<br /> <a href="http://intellihub.com/2013/09/28/powerful-changes-come-americans-arent/" target="_blank">Intellihuhb.com</a><br /> September 28, 2013</h6>
<p>Friday, on <a href="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2013/09/27" target="_blank"><em>Coast to Coast AM</em></a> hosted by John B. Wells filling in for George Noory, history was made as Wells unleashed a bombshell broadcast on a typically scheduled open-phones night. Against all odds <em>&#8220;command has acquiesced and allowed me to get a little crazy with it tonight. Crazy like a fox don&#8217;t you know&#8221;,</em> Wells stated on air during the show&#8217;s opener setting the ominous overtone for the powerful broadcast to follow entitled, the <em>Friday Night RAMA-Jama</em> (Revolutionary Alternative Media Assult-Jama)<sub>[1]</sub></p>
<p>First up to bat was Abby Martin, a journalist for <em>RT.com,</em> who knocked it out of the park touching on key topics which affect the American people directly. From the corruption of politics to the mainline press all reading from the same script, Abby says, <em>&#8220;It&#8217;s time to stop tiptoeing around these issues we  know are unlawful and unconstitutional and start calling them out [...] I&#8217;m just there challenging and undermining the establishment in every sense of the way, calling out the real players behind the game, challenging the corporatocracy.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>Abby is right, we do need to stop tiptoeing around. We need to hit these criminal rogue elements hard, not even giving them the opportunity to get back up onto their feet, because that&#8217;s what they are doing to us.</p>
<p>Everything that is now transpiring in America, the way U.S. Government is run, all of this is wrong. The government is simply not representing the American people&#8217;s interests as it should. The government has been overrun, salted, and is now fully controlled. Everything is opposite, it&#8217;s 180 degrees backwards, upside-down and inside-out. There is a push to break the backs of the American people, they want to strip us of our free-thinking skills.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;They want us to be mindless drones [...] the industrial robot was invented in 1961, they want to replace humans&#8221;,</em> Shepard Ambellas said, the second hour guest on Friday&#8217;s RAMA-Jama broadcast. <em>&#8220;They can&#8217;t have free-thinking individuals out there actually becoming citizen journalists, taking action for themselves, using platforms that are already there like Intellihub.com. [...] this is the world we live in now [...] things are getting serious.&#8221;, </em>Ambellas said, moving forward to talk about how people can&#8217;t even count anymore saying, <em>&#8220;they don&#8217;t want us to trust ourselves&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Ambellas is the founder and director of the popular alternative news website <a href="http://www.intellihub.com" target="_blank"><em>Intellihub.com</em></a> and is one of the makers of <a href="http://store.shadethemotionpicture.com/landing-1/?ap_id=unbound" target="_blank"><em>SHADE the Motion Picture</em></a> along with Jason Bermas, the maker of groundbreaking documentary films such as <em>Loose Change</em> and <em>Fabled Enemies. </em>Ambellas and Bermas plan to hit the globalists with a knock-out punch combo as their new film exposing a sinister agenda drops October 15th on DVD video, and October 18th on YouTube.com in 480p. The film was briefly mentioned during the broadcast.</p>
<p>Ambellas continued on to talk about other important issues, including the need for people to take action. Ambellas also raised the idea of forming his own so-called &#8220;Bilderberg Meeting&#8221; of sorts, as he plans to hold his own yearly gathering with all of the top and most predominant members of the alternative media, including celebrities and popular musicians and activist group from around the world to talk behind closed doors, fighting fire with fire. The idea is to let the Bilderbergers wonder what tricks the free-thinkers have up their sleeves waiting for them.</p>
<p>Hour number three got even better as the <em>Buzzsaw</em> crew jumped on the show with host John B. Wells.<em> Buzzsaw</em> is composed of Tyrel Ventura, Sean Stone and Tabetha Wallace, who form a formidable force in the alternative media. The crew touched on the need for &#8220;unity&#8221; and not &#8220;infighting&#8221;, which consequently is a problem in the so-called &#8220;truth&#8221; movement.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The alternative media is rising&#8221;,</em> host John B. Wells stated, going on the question how prevalent disinformation is in the press. Tyrel Ventura jumped in explaining how there is a need to vet any information regardless saying, <em>&#8220;that&#8217;s why people are moving to alternative news now, they feel that they have been lied to for so long and they&#8217;re hungry [...] people are no longer sitting on their hands. They want the truth.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Judging by the reactions of people I have spoken with thus far, this broadcast will likely become a favorite amongst the people, going down in history as one of the most game-changing <em>Coast to Coast AM</em> broadcasts ever as we are the media.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Wednesday, the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) release video footage and commented on the alleged Navy yard shooter Aaron Alexis, and his Extremely Low Frequency (ELF)<sub>[1]</sub> bombardment fantasies. Alexis was pinned by authorities to have killed 12 people in the Sept 16. domestic terror attack in which no specific person was targeted according to the FBI.</p>
<p>Valerie Parlave, Washington&#8217;s assistant FBI director is working the case. The rather grainy electronically blurred footage the FBI released of the Navy yard shooting shooter in action, really yields no proof of anything. The image is unrecognizable and the timestamp and meta data from the film seems to be missing, prompting some to do further investigation as they believe the FBI footage is a fraud.<sub>[2]</sub></p>
<p>The FBI also claims they found a message fragment in Alexis&#8217; records which may have alluded to the attack preemptively, reading, &#8220;Ultra-low frequency attack is what I’ve been subject to for the last 3 months, and to be perfectly honest that is what has driven me to this&#8221;. While all of this is still speculation, it has been announced that Alexis carved the words &#8220;My ELF Weapon&#8221; on the stock of his shotgun, stirring up controversy amongst conspiracy buffs.</p>
<p>In fact, it get stranger, <em>NewsOne.com</em> reported, &#8220;The attack came one month after Alexis had complained to police in Rhode Island that people were talking to him through the walls and ceilings of his hotel room and sending microwave vibrations into his body to deprive him of sleep.</p>
<p>On his shotgun, he had scrawled “My ELF Weapon!” – an apparent reference to extremely low-frequency waves – along with “End to the Torment!” “Not what y&#8217;all say” and “Better off this way,” the FBI said.&#8221;<sub>[3]</sub></p>
<p>It has also been reported the FBI felt that Alexis knew he would die in the Sept. 16 attack killing 12.</p>

<p>There has been a massive smoke and mirrors display in Washington lately as Democrats and Republicans battle it out to avoid a government shutdown on Oct. 1.</p>
<p>This is all mere window dressing to divert the good people of America&#8217;s attention away from what is really taking place in the world around them. Friday the <em>LATimes.com</em> reported, &#8220;The Senate is now expected to pass a Democratic amendment to strip a provision in the bill that cuts money for the Affordable Care Act. A simple majority is all that&#8217;s required for that vote.</p>
<p>A final vote will return the bill to the House, putting pressure on the Republican-controlled chamber to act with just three days left to avoid a government shutdown before the end of the federal fiscal year.&#8221;<sub>[1]</sub></p>
<p>But, with the recent looming government shutdown at hand, how could the government still be spending money to spray the American people like cockroaches? It&#8217;s a billion dollar industry, known as <a href="http://intellihub.com/2011/03/30/secret-presidential-chemtrail-budget-uncovered-exceeds-billions-to-spray-populations-like-roaches/" target="_blank"><strong>geoengineering</strong></a>.</p>

<p>A question had previously been raised by filmmaker Michael Murphy, and answered in the documentary film <em>What In the World Are the Spraying</em>. <em></em>The information that was provided in the film is critical for those learning about persistent contrails, i.e. chemtrails, to take in. However, as we are now entering a new tier of geoengineering, many in the world are now asking: who is doing this to us? And the epic new documentary film <strong><em><a href="http://store.shadethemotionpicture.com/intellihub/" target="_blank">Shade the Motion Picture</a> </em></strong>answers just that.</p>
<p>Taking it further, the world is now demanding accountability.</p>
<p><em>Editors note: As an introduction to this article, we will first cover information to familiarize the uninformed readers as to the core facts and information so that a more complete understanding is possible, given this complex issue.</em></p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o4NNLN_BpU&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">recent report</a> by <em><a href="http://www.cbsatlanta.com/index.html" target="_blank">CBS Atlanta</a></em> detailed how some local citizens are outraged that such “crimes against humanity” are being carried out right before our eyes in secret.</p>
<p>In the report <a href="http://isakson.senate.gov/" target="_blank">Sen. Johnny Isakson</a> was interviewed on the subject of chemtrails saying quote<em>:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“That is a theory that some people have, but there is no evidence this is happening. This is not happening.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks as if members of the government’s upper echelon and even members of the Senate will go to extreme lengths to suppress this vital information from reaching the American people.</p>
<p>Not to mention they signed off on the multi-billion dollar per year budgets in an economic crisis, with little to no transparency to the public.</p>
<p>In regards to aerosol spraying into the earth’s atmosphere, a recent update to data assembled by <a href="http://carnicominstitute.org/" target="_blank">The Carnicom Institute</a> reveals the chemicals used and their respective levels of concentration. The toxic levels that are being used in these aerosols goes beyond shocking – it would appear that these levels are indeed criminal by <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/airpollutants.html" target="_blank">EPA Standards</a>.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The Fund for Innovative Climate and Energy Research (FICER) exists to accelerate the innovative development and evaluation of science and technology to address carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions and their environmental consequences.</p>
<p>The non-profit research fund focuses on early-stage innovative research where relatively small and timely grants can significantly advance understanding, especially of the viability and scalability of proposals to address global warming.</p>
<p>Funded research projects are intended to produce peer-reviewed scholarly articles in recognized professional scientific and technical journals. Any intellectual property that may be generated in the course of such research resides with the researchers or their institutions. </p>
<p>Grants for research are provided to the University of Calgary from gifts made by Mr. Bill Gates from his personal funds.</p>
<p>The activities of the Fund for Innovative Climate and Energy Research fall outside the scope of activities of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. FICER is not a Foundation project and has no relationship with it.</p>
<p>The fund has supported research in a wide range of areas. Some examples include:</p>
<p>• understanding carbon dioxide emissions associated with international trade in goods and services;</p>
<p>• developing technologies to capture carbon dioxide out of the air; and</p>
<p>• climate modeling to understand possible environmental consequences of solar radiation management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3> Report On Geoengineering Activities</h3>
<p>A global crime syndicate has incrementally managed to embed a select group of criminal puppets into the interior of United States government (i.e. the Corporation of the United States) and is responsible for what some would say are ‘crimes against humanity’. These tyrants will stop at nothing to usher their hush, hush global aerosol agenda into full swing.</p>
<p>According to a report prepared for the Air Force titled “<a href="http://theintelhubradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Weather-As-a-Force-Multiplier-.pdf" target="_blank">Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the WeatherBy 2025</a>” the U.S. Air Force wants to fully control the weather on earth by the year 2025.</p>
<p>Far surpassing even the most horrific act of terror (real or staged), posing as literal gods, these globalists will stop at nothing to control the world by not only controlling the fraudulent banking systems but by owning the weather through a process (blanket term) called geoengineering.</p>
<p>According to globalist sponsored reports, our planet is in a constant state of threat and is being bombarded with radioactive solar rays increasing planetary temperatures due to human carbon emissions.</p>
<p>However, vast bodies of research now show that that is not the case and that global warming is a another globalist myth, a ponzi scheme to collect a Carbon Tax worldwide, benefitting the very same group behind the curtain.</p>
<p>The myth the global warming “Carbon Tax” pushers have been spouting apparently can only be  fixed by spraying deadly toxins in an aerosol particulate form into the earths atmosphere via large sprayer converted aircraft specifically assigned to perform Geoengineering tasks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aerosol sprays (slang: Chemtrails) are filled with a variety of chemical and metal compounds and are known to be very hazardous to human, plant, and animal health worldwide. This danger to plant and human and animal health has been documented in films such as “What In the World Are They Spraying” by Michael Murphy &amp; G. Edward Griffin, who have also appeared on the<em> Intellihub Radio Show</em> with Shepard Ambellas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, this issue was originally a matter for the EPA to rule over considering that they have the authority to sanction geoengineering activities under the National Environmental Policy ACT of 1969. However, documents such as the report to the chairman, Committee of Science and Technology, House of Representatives – “Climate Change” – Sept. 2010, U.S. Gov. Accountability Office which was submitted to all members of congress in 2010 attempt to put control into the hands of even a smaller group of people.</p>
<p>This report clearly is slanted and leans to take control away from the EPA along with other regulatory provisions such as; the Endangered Species ACT, and the Conformity Provision in the Clean Air ACT – total Geoengineering dis-info submitted to members of the Congress and other government branches alike.</p>
<p>The source of most of the dis-info is Obama’s White House Science Czar John P. Holdren. The following was written on USGCRP letterhead;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>January 2011,</p>
<p>Members of Congress:</p>
<p>On behalf of the National Science and Technology Council, I am transmitting a copy of <a href="http://downloads.globalchange.gov/ocp/ocp2011/ocp2011.pdf" target="_blank">Our Changing Planet: The U.S. Global Change Research Program for Fiscal Year 2011</a>. The report describes the activities and plans of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) established under the Global Change Research Act (GCRA) of 1990. The USGCRP coordinates and integrates scientific research on climate and global change and is supported by 13 participating departments and agencies of the U.S. government. This Fiscal Year 2011 edition of Our Changing Planet highlights recent advances and progress made by participating agencies and includes budget information on each agency’s contribution.</p>
<p>This report describes a program in transition. In accordance with the GCRA, the USGCRP agencies requested guidance from the National Research Council on how to best meet the changing needs of the nation to understand climate change and respond to its impacts, and the NRC responded with a 2009 report entitled “Restructuring Federal Climate Research to Meet the Challenges of Climate Change”. In accord with that report’s recommendations, the USGCRP is undergoing a strategic realignment that will ensure that the science produced is maximally useful for decision makers at all scales. As described in the new edition of Our Changing Planet, the program going forward will place greater emphasis on impacts, vulnerabilities, and on understanding the options for adapting to the changing climate. The program will also continue its long-standing support for activities that contribute to a better understanding of the Earth system, including observations, research, and predictive modeling.</p>
<p>All of these focuses will be reflected in the USGCRP’s new strategic plan and its National Climate Assessment.</p>
<p>The USGCRP is committed to its mission to build a knowledge base that informs human responses to global change through coordinated and integrated federal programs of research, education, communication, and decision support. I appreciate the close cooperation of the participating agencies, and I look forward to working with the Congress in the continued development and implementation of this essential national program.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><em>John P. Holdren Director,</em> <em>Office of Science and Technology Policy Assistant to the President for Science and Technology” – Our Changing Planet</em></p>
<p>Even more disturbing then that is the fact that your so called representatives have been approving yearly geoengineering budgets in the upwards of billions of dollars per year (as outlined in the document “Our Changing Planet – The US Global Change Research Program for the Fiscal Year of 2011, which is a supplement to the Presidents Budget for 2011, much of which is unaccounted for and not even included in the budget possible signifying even a more nefarious plot involving some black budget.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back tracking to the year 2001,  President elect George W. Bush established the (CCRI) Climate Change Research Initiative. A year later it was made public that the USGCRP or United States Global Change Research program and the CCRI both would become what is known as the (CCSP) Climate Change Science Program. Now, under the Obama Administration the legacy continues to move forward as the USGCRP.</p>
<p>A report entitled “Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States” released in 2009, documents how the USGCRP divided the US into nine regions similar to FEMA regions. Also tucked into the report was the statement “A central finding of the report was that the vast majority of climate scientists agree that global warming is unequivocal and primarily human induced” – Source: Our Changing Planet.</p>
<p>The document goes on to mention the devastating effects of climate change, including the effect on crops, human health and livestock.</p>
<p>But the most startling fact in the document is the actual budget itself, a mere 2.7 billion for 2011 alone (not including many costs) 24% higher than 2010’s budget.</p>

<p>A description of the subcommittee on (p.2) Our Changing Planet Reads;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The <a href="http://www.globalchange.gov/" target="_blank">USGCRP</a> is directed by the Subcommittee for Global Change Research (SGCR), which falls under the National Science and Technology Council. The SGCR comprises representatives from 13 departments and agencies and is led by a Chair from one of the participating agencies (currently from the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA]). In order to align the program’s governance with the needs, Vice- Chairs have been identified for Strategic Planning, Integrated Observations, and Adaptation Research. Additional vice-chairs will be identified as needed. The program is supported by the USGCRP Integration and Coordination Office and conducts many of its activities through interagency working groups that plan and implement research and crosscutting activities, such as communications, decision support, and information and data concerns. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) work closely with the SGCR, the Integration and Coordination Office, and the interagency working groups to establish research priorities and funding plans to ensure that the program is aligned with national priorities, reflects agency planning, and meets the requirements of the GCRA. “</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Subcommittee in question has now supplied the President with a supplement to the fiscal budget for 2011, which was presented to members of congress in January of 2011 on behalf of the National Science and Technology Policy – Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, John P. Holdren.</p>
<p>The (<a href="http://www.globalchange.gov/" target="_blank">USGCRP</a>) brings together a total of 13 different agencies and merges them into one single agency program that has been in the works science 1988 or prior.</p>
<p>In 1990 the USGCRP received generous congressional support under (GCRA P.L. 101-606). It is no mystery that aerosol spraying operations have been ongoing since the early 1990’s. Prior to 1990 one could enjoy a true clear blue sky, a figment of the past in 2011 – where none are to be found.</p>
<p>So just how deep does the geoengineering/terraforming rabbit hole go?<em>Intellihub.com</em> was able to obtain a copy of the final report prepared by the University of Calgary under contract by Aurora Flight Sciences titled “Geoengineering cost analysis.”</p>
<p>In the report there is smoking gun evidence of the entire geoengineering saga from the secret bases, to the payload, to what type of aircraft or “airship” will be the most cost effective to spread toxic particulates throughout the earths atmosphere.</p>
<p>The final report also included budgets for different applications for aerosol dispersal within the atmosphere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Existing aircraft are evaluated based on cost of acquisition and operations. An in-depth new aircraft design study and cost analysis was conducted to determine the cost of developing and operating a dedicated geoengineering airplane type. Similarly, an airship design study and cost analysis was conducted. Finally a survey of non-aircraft systems was conducted to determine how their costs compare to aircraft and airships.</em></p>
<p><em>Yearly costs of 1M tonne geoengineering operations for all the systems examined are presented in Figure 2. Some systems are easily written off due to extremely high costs. Rocket based systems are not cost competitive due to the large number of launches required and the impact of occasional rocket failures on required fleet size. A system based on 16Σ” naval Mark 7 guns was analyzed and compared to previous work by the National Research Council.4 This system requires large numbers of shots increasing projectile costs and driving yearly costs over $100B. Gun costs become more competitive if the projectile payload fraction can be increased from about 10% for a standard shell to 50%. With this and a few improvements over the 1940-era Mark 7 gun yearly costs are still in the $20B range….The primary vehicles examined to lift particulate to stratospheric altitudes and disperse them at a predetermined release rate are airplanes and airships; rockets and other non- aircraft methods such as guns and suspended pipes are also surveyed.” –<a href="http://theintelhubradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/AuroraGeoReport.pdf" target="_blank">Aurora Flight Sciences: Geoengineering Final Report</a></em><em> (p.5)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Geoengineering may provide a means to create a time buffer against catastrophic cli- mate change while long-term emissions reduction actions take effect. One approach is to disperse sulfur compounds at high altitude to reduce the effective solar flux entering the atmosphere. This report will evaluate the means of delivering sufficient mass of this or similar material to affect climate change on a global scale. The goal of this study is to use engineering design and cost analysis to determine the feasibility and cost of a delivering material to the stratosphere for solar radiation management (SRM). </em><em>This study does not</em><em>examine effectiveness or risks of injecting material into the stratosphere for SRM. </em><em>Its goal is simply to compare a range of delivery systems on a single cost basis.” – <a href="http://theintelhubradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/AuroraGeoReport.pdf" target="_blank">Aurora Flight Sciences: Geoengineering Final Report</a></em><em> (p.6)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The </em><a href="http://theintelhubradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/AuroraGeoReport.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> mentions how payload costs are not included in the estimate nor are the base/facility costs and continues on (p.8) to say;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“This study focuses on airplane and airship operations to the stratosphere to release a geoengineering payload with the goal of reducing incoming solar flux. Airships are also considered for this mission. To provide a comparison to conventional aircraft operations, more exotic concepts such as rockets, guns, and suspended pipes are also examined….For maximum cooling impact, the particulate payloads are best placed near the equator. This study assumes that the payload is released within latitudes 30°N and 30°S, though North-South basing location had minimal effect on cost. Transit operations, flying East- West between equally spaced bases around the equator, were examined as a method to ensure adequate dispersal of the payload around the equator. Global winds aid in East-West dispersal so a smaller number of bases and shorter range systems (referred to as Regional operations) can be employed with minimal impact on dispersal. Region- al operations allow the dispersal leg length to be dictated by the desired release rate of 0.03kg/m flown. This means the airplanes fly no further than they have to, on the order of 300-800 km, and fuel costs are minimized.” – Aurora Flight Sciences: Geoengineering Final report Yearly cost estimates from different dispersal methods ranged from over 1 billion dollars a year all the way up to rocket dispersed aerosol in the upper atmosphere at the cost of over 100 billion dollars per year.</em></p>

<p><em>Today Americans would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order; tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will pledge with world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well being granted to them by their world government.” – </em>Henry Kissinger in an address to the Bilderbergers at Evian, France, May 21, 1992.</p>

<p>Senator Lindsey Graham(R-SC) and many other senators are attempting to pull the wool over the American people's eyes.  With the 2014 elections staring RINOs (Republicans in name only) in the face, they are seeking to save face in the light of their spineless behavior.  Over the weekend Graham attempted to deceive his followers in sending out a letter in which he claims to have voted to defund Obamacare.
</p>
<p>Last week, following <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/09/ted-cruz-stands-america-nearly-22-hours-obamacare-funding-harry-reid-says-waste-time/">Senator Ted Cruz's 21+ talk on the Senate floor</a> to inform the American people of the impact of Obamacare, the Senate <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00206">voted 79-19</a> (all 19 were Republican) for cloture on the House spending bill on Friday.  That bill would have funded government under a continuing resolution till approximately December 15, 2013, but would have defunded the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.
</p>
<p>Many have asked what cloture is.  According to the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/cloture.htm">Senate's glossary</a>, cloture is:
</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The only procedure by which the Senate can <a href="http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Filibuster_Cloture.htm">vote to place a time limit on consideration of a bill </a>or other matter, and thereby overcome a filibuster. Under the cloture rule (Rule XXII), the Senate may limit consideration of a pending matter to 30 additional hours, but only by <a href="http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/cloture_motions/clotureCounts.htm">vote </a>of three-fifths of the full Senate, normally 60 votes.<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, Graham, along with others wanted to get on with a vote without allowing for an actual filibuster.  This is precisely what Ted Cruz warned about and said:
</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Any Senator who votes yes (on Friday's cloture vote) is voting to give Harry Reid the power" to fund Obamacare. "That vote is the fight. Vote no on cloture."<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3cADy61zzMc?feature=player_detailpage" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Cruz called for Republicans to unite behind the effort and then begin to put pressure on Democrats.  He said that if the Reid cloture vote was defeated, "then the House can stand its ground."
</p>
<p>We see what that got us.  The House immediately <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/09/house-upholds-funding-government-seeks-obamacare-1-year-delay-repeal-medical-device-tax/">began to compromise with the bill</a>, offering to delay Obamacare for one year and get the medical device tax repealed.
</p>
<p>So, back to Senator Graham, who <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00206">voted for cloture</a>, which in essence was giving Reid and the Democrats exactly what they wanted.  Graham knew by doing this that Obamacare would not be defunded, and he didn't even put up a fight.
</p>
<p>However, when the final vote came, every Republican voted against Obamacare funding.  This is how Lindsey Graham is claiming that he voted against funding Obamacare while not actually fighting against it.
</p>
<p>Here's his letter to his constituents, of which I am one.
</p>
<table style="width:100%;">
<tbody >
<tr>
<td style="padding-right:75px;"><a href="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/093013_1556_LindseyGrah1.jpg"><img src="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/093013_1556_LindseyGrah1.jpg" alt="093013_1556_LindseyGrah1.jpg" width="505" height="699" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12278" /></a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Notice the blatant lie just before the bullet points of ways he attempted to "fight" against Obamacare.  </p>
<blockquote><p>"I fought and voted against Obamacare in 2010.  <strong>Since then, I have tried to stop the law's implementation any way I can</strong>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>
<p>Except in the vote on cloture Senator Graham.
</p>
<p></strong>
<p>Graham didn't do anything but join hands with some of his colleagues like Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and blast Ted Cruz for his willingness to stand against the majority of the Senate in opposition to funding Obamacare.
</p>
<p>Rest assured that Graham is not the only Republican senator using deceptive methods when it comes to talking about defunding Obamacare.
<p>Forget the technical vote about funding Obamacare.  Once Graham and other Republicans voted for cloture, they were in essence knowingly allowing Reid and the Democrats to put Obama funding back into the spending bill.  They just weren't ready to do the tough job of standing up and being counted.  This has led to compromise in the House,and my guess is that it will lead to an even greater compromise this time around in the Senate.</p>

<h4>Democracy: Now you see it and now you don't!</h4>
<p>Something is happening in Greece and global elitists don't like it so they are up to their regular shenanigans that deprive people of their rights and due process. No worries though. It's all in the name of routing evil. Okay, whatever. Let's ask Golden Dawn leaders though.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_12269" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 220px"><a href="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/greece-arrests.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-12269 " alt="&quot;I won't go and you can't make me!&quot;" src="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/greece-arrests-300x200.jpg" width="210" height="140" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">"I won't go and you can't make me!"</p></div>Apparently, the Golden Dawn political group in Greece is now seen as a Neo-Nazi group so police have begun arresting their leaders and are essentially doing their level best to shut down the political party because of it. The authorities have gone so far as to charge leaders as being part of a "<a href="http://topconservativenews.com/2013/09/greece-arrests-golden-dawn-members-of-parliament/">criminal organization</a>." This party is an extreme right-wing party in Greece so elitists don't like that. To make matters worse, "a Greek 'Gangster Rapper' singer known as 'P Killa' was stabbed to death. The suspected killer had Golden Dawn campaign materials at his house. The murder is being used to as an excuse to try to outlaw a major political party."</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but this is too hilarious to be true. A Greek gangster rapper was found to have Golden Dawn campaign materials in his home when police found his body? Wow, how convenient. Beyond this, the <a href="http://rt.com/news/greece-golden-dawn-leader-arrest-481/">individual accused of killing</a> P Killa is said to be "George Roupakias, 45, an avowed supporter of Golden Dawn."</p>
<p>You know, every time there is a mass shooting here in America, the news immediately goes to their default position of trying to prove that the gunman was a "right-winger" who was crazy. It usually turns out that the shooter is a left-winger and crazy, but the same news bureaus never follow up on that once the truth comes to light.</p>
<p>Of course, to make matters even more unfair, "Left-wing, Marxist Greek parties are notoriously violent and have been engaged in criminal street violence for years. In 2008, tens of thousands of left-wing thugs rioted for three weeks and caused massive destruction and violence in Greece. The left-wing parties are never called to account for their violent members and supporters."</p>
<blockquote><p>We've experienced that here in the United States as well with the differences in the way Occupy protestors were treated and even referenced, as compared to the Tea Party. The former was frequently seen as protesting capitalism and cronyism, and was largely funded by George Soros (among others). The Tea Party is frequently seen as anti-government, racist, and more.  In spite of their best efforts, those on the left simply cannot make these charges stick. The Tea Party is opposed to unchecked government growth and spending. But what do facts matter to those on the left?</p></blockquote>
<p>Could it be that the global elite has the same problem with the Golden Dawn political party in Greece that it does with the Tea Party in America? I mean, after all, groups like these make it very difficult to dismantle a sovereign nation, doesn't it? That just gets the Global Elite's underwear all bunched up, and we all know how that feels.</p>
<p>In reality, the problem may well be that, like the Tea Party, <a href="http://rt.com/news/greece-golden-dawn-leader-arrest-481/">Golden Dawn</a> has experienced some major growth in a very short amount of time. "Police have detained about 30 members of the ultra-right party, which won 18 seats in the Greek parliament in the June 2012 elections, having received close to 7 percent of the popular vote."</p>
<p>Of course, part of the problem is that an investigation showed that some of the police in Greece had been involved in training individuals in the para-military wing of Golden Dawn. The Tea Party has no such beast.</p>
<p>What people are afraid to talk about is the fact that Greece is heavily Socialist, and it is desperately running out of money to the point that the EU has had to bail them out, twice. People are upset and they want change. Well, they're getting it, but of course, if things continue as they are, we can expect full martial law there soon.</p>
<p>Makes you wonder how long we have before martial law kicks in for America. I actually heard a progressive the other day state that America's deficit is nearly gone because sequestration has worked. The person making the claim was not a national figure. He is employed by a leftist company and he thoroughly believes what he told me. This guy has more than his head buried deeply in the sand. This man is a very intelligent man too, yet, he is blind to the realities that plague the USA.</p>
<p>Oh well, time will reveal all things. Wait for it...</p>

<p>You know that guy that sneaks out at lunch every day and throws back a few? He always comes back chewing gum and all of your co-workers know. It has been alleged that a number of our elected servants couldn't address government shutdowns and Obamacare without first throwing a few back this weekend.

<p>There is nothing wrong with having a few drinks on your own time, but company time is supposed to be off limits, at least with most occupations. Most would agree that those who drink on the job are showing the signs of a full blown alcoholic. Alcoholics don't often abide by any kind of etiquette with their drinking. How do I know this? Well, I am a recovering alcoholic myself. I drank before (and after) my own wedding. By the grace of God, it's been 2 years now since my last drink. Previously, I made it to 5 years before screwing up. I am not the type that can stop at 1 or 2, and envy those who can.
</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with drinking unless you are an alcoholic and there have long been rumors of several of them in congress.
</p>
<p>John Boehner is at the top of the list of alleged alcoholics and maybe we should start with him. If you simply type "John Boehner alcoholic" in Google, you will have your choice of many wonderful tales of his habitual drinking and carousing with Capitol Hill staffers.
</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Former U.S. Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, admits he broke the law and deserved to be sent to prison, but he <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/03/insider-spills-beans-on-d-c-s-dirty-secrets/">told WND</a> the corrupt political system desperately needs changing and House Speaker John Boehner is part of the problem.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>…<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>"I've known John Boehner for over two-and-a-half decades. I don't hate John Boehner. Was I angry at John Boehner in 2006? You better believe it. I make no bones about that. But John Boehner has always been, and this is my opinion, but I think the opinion of many, on the lazy side in the sense that he's a get-along guy. He doesn't like a lot of controversy. He's always enjoyed the golfing. I would have to term it an addiction for John Boehner," Ney said.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>"I'm not calling anyone an alcoholic, being a recovering alcoholic, but I've got to tell you John Boehner is a constant drinker of wine. He's been seen with lobbyists for decades on a nightly basis and drinking. I'm not judging him, but I think it's part of the story.<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not just Boehner. Check out what Ron Paul said in an interview on Larry King Live as reported by <a href="http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Ron_Paul_Stephen_Baldwin_debate_marijuana_0314.html">The Raw Story</a> in 2009:
</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"I understand there's a few people who smoke marijuana already," said Paul, laughing. "And, how many times have you seen someone arrested for driving under the influence of marijuana? I mean, I've never heard of it! Driving under the influence of alcohol … That is dangerous."<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Paul attributed current laws to a widespread fear of political retribution in Congress, among many members who "drink a lot of alcohol" at that.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>"Are you saying that there are a lot of alcoholics in Congress?" asked guest host Joy Behar.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Paul backpedaled. "I said there's a lot of people in Congress who drink a lot of alcohol."<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>"They won't vote to legalize it," he added with a laugh.<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't care what any of these guys do when they are "off the clock." I would rather they not drink and party on my tax dollars, but it truly is none of my business what they do in their personal life if it is not illegal, but, knowing what we know, and suspecting what we suspect, would it surprise you if your congressional servants turned this weekend's crucial ObamaCare/Government shutdown debate into a little party? Would it concern you if there was a little booze involved in those late night negotiations?
</p>
<p>It does me.
</p>
<p>I'm not saying it effects votes. I'm not saying it effects a lot, but it is common decency to refrain from such things when the whole country is counting on your sound judgment.
</p>
<p>Isn't that right John McCain? <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/09/birds-of-a-feather-barack-obama-played-cards-during-osama-bin-laden-raid-john-mccain-played-poker-during-syria-hearing/">Playing video poker is acceptable of course</a>, but drinking on the job is where any good RINO should draw the line.
</p>
<p>Well, you should always consider the source but a couple of left-leaning journalists reported that this weekend's activities in the House of Representatives were not all business.
</p>
<p>Ginger Gibson is congressional reporter for Politico:

<p>I think all conservatives should be offended that liberal journalists are exposing our representatives as mindless drunkards. This is not news. We have known this for years.
</p>
<p>However, this is not anywhere close to acceptable. This really is worse than John McCain playing video poker, or at least every bit as bad. I don't like John McCain, so I am not trying to take his side, but come on…
</p>
<p>My tax money is paying you around a quarter-mill a year, and you can't even stay sober for one of the most important legislative debates in our nation's history?
</p>
<p>I'd like to know who it was and, though I do not doubt the story is true, it is a little odd that this reporter didn't bother to find out:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p>For all those asking for names, sorry, I didn&#39;t get close enough to figure out the source of the smell.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It's a much bigger story if a few names are attached to it.
</p>
<p>These people work for us and if this really happened, which I think it probably did, then they need to be fired or placed on leave and sent to rehab.
</p>
<p>The American people deserve better than that.
</p>
<p>You don't drink on "company" time and these men and women should not be drinking at work either. But then again, this is congress.
</p>
<p>They don't abide by the same laws that we do.
</p>
<p>I remember a day at school when I happened to launch the perfect spit ball that landed just a few inches from Sister Sienna's hand as she was writing on the chalkboard.
</p>
<p>Sister Sienna knew how to get to the truth. She threatened to keep the whole class in for recess if no one admitted to launching that spit ball.
</p>
<p>I caved.
</p>
<p>If I had my way I'd stand before all 435 of them and use the same tactic.
</p>
<p>"None of you clowns get paid until I find out who stole the booze from John Boehner's briefcase."
</p>
<p>If Sister Sienna were still alive she would find out.</p>

<p>President Obama wants you to believe that government is not only your very best friend, but that without it, you are lost. He wants you to believe that without the government, you couldn't even wipe your backside properly.
</p>
<p>Obama wants us to "<a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/09/rep-joe-wilson-right-barack-obama-lie/">reject the voices that warn of tyranny</a>."

</p>
<p>Well of course he says that, because that is exactly what he is perpetrating upon you and me; <em>tyranny</em>!  This president has shown <em>by his actions</em>, that he doesn't give a fig about democracy, the Republic, liberty or freedom. He has gone out of his way to crush Christianity, American values and free thinking. Why do you think he and other so-called "Democrats," think the Tea Party are anarchists and traitors?
</p>
<p>Because we are standing right in his face and calling him out for the <em>liar</em> and <em>tyrant</em> that he is! Why do you think that Obama and his goons try to belittle us by calling us "teabaggers"? Because that is what we are to him...a <em>threat</em>!
</p>
<p>This administration has done more to harm our country, our values and our freedom more than ten Adolph Hitlers ever could. And they are building a domestic army to crush us. You should watch this video:

<p>As he signed the document, Kerry called the treaty a "significant step" in addressing illegal gun sales, while claiming it would also protect gun rights.

<p>How stupid does this administration think "We the People" are?
</p>
<p>Obama has something BIG planned, and by all appearances it looks like a hostile takeover of this country. Why else would he push Obamacare down our throats at all costs? Why is the Department of Homeland Security building up an arsenal? Why is this administration purging the military of people of heterosexual Christian values? Why the harassment by the IRS of the Tea Party? Why do you think that the NSA is spying on American citzens...to "keep us safe"? C'mon folks, let's get real about this.
</p>
<p>I am not a "conspiracy nut," but I can add that this is the reason Diane Feinstein <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/09/feinstein-wants-define-journalist/">wants to redefine who is a "journalist" and who isn't</a>. They want to force the silence of the opposition as much as possible. That's not very "liberal," now is it? In fact, that's just one of the ways they are going about this, under the mantel of "Liberalism," which is the new code word for Socialism, Marxism and Communism.
</p>
<p>The answer is right there in front of you; all you have to do is look at all the variables, and you will have the answer to the equation.
</p>
<p>We should reject the voices that warn that tyranny is right around the corner?  I don't think so.  <strong>Tyranny <em>is</em> right around the corner!</strong> </p>

<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">In the wake of <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/09/2-million-bikers-invade-d-c-remind-us-911-still-means-something-real-americans/" target="_blank">bikers roaring through the streets of DC in protest</a> and just ahead of a planned <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/09/1-million-truckers-to-shut-down-america-protest-gains-momentum-rally-date-approached/" target="_blank">shut down of DC by truckers</a>, founder of Judicial Watch Larry Klayman has set a date of November 19,2013 on which he is calling for Americans to "descend on Washington, D.C., en masse, and demand that he leave town and resign from office if he does not want to face prison time" for pushing "his Muslim, socialist, anti-Semitic, anti-Christian, anti-white, pro-illegal immigrant, pro-radical gay and lesbian agenda."<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Klayman is an attorney who <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2012/07/plaintiff-appeals-obama-eligibility-following-judges-dismissal/">has brought</a> <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/03/obama-eligibility-appealed-in-judge-roy-moores-court/">numerous cases</a> against Barack Obama concerning his eligibility to hold the office of President of the United States.  However, instead of the judges in these cases allowing them to go forward, they are dismissing them.  So far, that has not been the case with the <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/03/obama-eligibility-appealed-in-judge-roy-moores-court/">Alabama Supreme Court</a>, in which <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/05/multiple-obama-birth-certificates-surface-in-alabama-eligibility-case/">mulitiple Obama birth certificates have surfaced.</a><br />
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">He has also mused about a military coup to oust Barack Obama following the Egyptian uprising that ousted former Muslim Brotherhood Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi earlier this year.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Larry Klayman claims that Obama, "like Morsi before his downfall," is "pushing the American people to the limit" and "playing with fire among the military."<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">"If this display by our most distinguished and honored American military heroes is any indication, given the state of affairs generally in this nation, which borders on total political, economic, moral and ethical collapse," Klayman asks, "is it inconceivable that one day the military in this country could rise up in support of not only the American people, but themselves, and remove Obama and his radical Muslim, socialist comrades by whatever means prove necessary to preserve the republic?"<br />
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">There have been many calls for a revolution from Klayman involving demonstrations, using the same tactics of Mahatma Gandhi and Egyptian protestors to "shut the city down, by blocking roads and massing in front of the White House" and "bringing the victims of his reign of terror" to Lafayette Park.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">In fact, Klayman says that Obama is worse than King George III.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">"King George III may have been a greedy 'control freak,' but at least he was a Christian. The United States is being run by a Muslim bent on furthering an Islamic caliphate who seeks to destroy our spirituality and the body politic of our Judeo-Christian roots."<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">With that said, Klayman encouraged Americans to rid the nation of the usurper.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">"Let us now walk in their footsteps and march into to Washington, D.C., this November 19th, and rid the nation of the criminal who lurks in our White House," he said.<br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/klayman/130916"><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">According</span></a><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt"> to Klayman, an uprising is needed "to cleanse the nation of the half-Muslim, anti-white, socialist fraud in the White House before the nation goes under for the final count."<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Klayman <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/klayman/130916">added</a>, "And, when we do converge on and 'Occupy Washington' in the millions on a date to be announced for the week before Thanksgiving, the people may think about chanting: 'Mr. President (to use the term loosely), put the Quran down, get up off your knees and come out with your hands up!'<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">"[Obama] will finally know that his time has come to leave his perverted, Islamic concept of Mecca, our nation's hallowed capital," Klayman <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/klayman/130916">concludes</a>. "I do not advocate violence, but it is time we show Obama that we mean business. He would be well advised to ride off into his Islamic sunset, link up with 72 virgins and party on at his expense – not ours."<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Here's the text, in part, of Larry Klayman's latest <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/klayman/130923">call for Revolution</a>:<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt"><em>On November 19, 2013, a day that will hopefully live on in the history of our once great republic, I call upon millions of Americans who have been appalled and disgusted by Obama's criminality – his Muslim, socialist, anti-Semitic, anti-Christian, anti-white, pro-illegal immigrant, pro-radical gay and lesbian agenda – among other outrages, to descend on Washington, D.C., en masse, and demand that he leave town and resign from office if he does not want to face prison time.<br/><br/>I further propose that we borrow the techniques perfected and used by such epic crusaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, to show Obama and his enablers that the American people are more than fed up and will not take it anymore. The millions who are being summoned to our nation's capital should, like Gandhi did in India and South Africa, peacefully shut the city down, by blocking roads and massing in front of the White House chanting for Obama to get out of our nation's capital. In addition, I propose bringing the victims of his reign of terror to a podium across from the White House in Lafayette Park to give their testimony on how he has singularly severely harmed and in some instances even killed their loved ones through his actions.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>We must act now. Our Founding Fathers pledged their sacred honor, fortunes, and lives to form a new nation under God. They knew that the odds of defeating the British were not great, save for His Divine grace and intervention. Now, 237 years after they signed the Declaration of Independence in my native city of Philadelphia, the nation has come full circle to the tyranny that has been imposed by a new despot, one far more evil than King George III. King George III may have been a greedy "control freak," but at least he was a Christian. The United States is being run by a Muslim bent on furthering an Islamic caliphate who seeks to destroy our spirituality and the body politic of our Judeo-Christian roots.<br/><br/>Life is not easy. It requires risk and sacrifice. If as a nation we want to restore our freedom, and we are on the verge of being enslaved under Obama's socialist Muslim inclinations, we must take our fight to a new level. Tea partiers, bikers, construction workers, police officers, school teachers, farmers, truckers, clergy, housewives, husbands, students, doctors, lawyers and all elements of our society who see our nation slipping away into the abyss, must now stand tall and descend on the capital, much like the Egyptians recently did in ousting another radical Muslim, their then president Mohammed Morsi. If the Egyptians can seek to rid their country of the poison of the Muslim Brotherhood without any real history of democracy, then we Americans, who know what democracy is and have practiced it prior to the ascension of the great usurper, can and must succeed.<br/><br/>Obama has now been convicted of having defrauded the American people into electing him as president. Even more so than Nixon during Watergate, he has no legitimacy to remain president and must be forced to resign. If We the People do not demand justice and remove him from office, then we will be furthering his fraud and we will have no one but ourselves to blame for the death of the greatest nation ever to have been on this earth.<br/><br/>In the words of one of our great Founding Fathers and an architect of our Constitution, "we must, indeed, all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately." Benjamin Franklin walked the walk along with the likes of George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson. Let us now walk in their footsteps and march into to Washington, D.C., this November 19th, and rid the nation of the criminal who lurks in our White House. Let us send a message to the other corrupt government officials of all political persuasions, that this is our nation, not theirs. Let's "Occupy Washington" and restore freedom to our shores!</em></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">If you recall, Senator Joe Machin (D-WV) aligned himself with Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) earlier this year to push some of the most sweeping gun control legislation the United States has ever seen.  Thankfully, <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/04/manchin-toomey-suffers-a-delicious-defeat/">they were defeated</a>.  However, now a video has surfaced in which Senator Manchin admits he takes money from Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Even more disturbing than Manchin being greased by Bloomberg (no pun intended), is the fact that Manchin claims the US Constitution can be changed through legislation!<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/wpBviqoYfeI?feature=player_detailpage" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Jeremy McGowan, from the <a href="http://wvcdl.org">West Virginia Citizen's Defense League </a>, recently interviewed Senator Manchin about several issues regarding gun control.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Senator Manchin admitted to taking money from Bloomberg in order to "off-set the unfairness going on" and the "tax they were enduring."<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">We reported earlier that Bloomberg has some serious issues with <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/06/mayor-michael-bloomberg-busted-using-taxpayer-money-to-fund-mayors-against-illegal-guns/">using taxpayer money to fund his Mayors Against Illegal Guns organization</a>.  We also reported that many mayors have <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/06/mayors-leave-bloombergs-gun-grab-organization-over-lies-witch-hunts/">left the organization claiming that they were unaware of the lies and witch hunts of the organization</a>, and Mayor Brian Maher claims that MAIG <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/08/mayor-brian-maher-michael-bloombergs-anti-gun-group-mayors-against-illegal-guns-tried-to-buy-me-off/">attempted to buy him off when he tried to leave</a>.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Echoing <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/04/michael-bloomberg-constitution-will-have-to-change-for-greater-security/">sentiments expressed by Mayor Bloomberg</a> back in April<strong>, Joe Manchin can be first overheard claiming the US Constitution can be changed through legislation</strong> - completely discounting the <em>actual</em> process of Constitutional amendments. Afterwards the Senator claims he will overturn an Executive Order by Obama.  Obviously, that is not how things work. <br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Senator Manchin also says that he will overturn an Executive Order from Barack Obama.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">During the interview, Manchin was asked how he could reconcile his statements on needing less regulation while Beretta USA claimed he was a reason the company chose not to relocate to West Virginia.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Manchin replied, "Beretta, to say they are being disingenuous is an understatement... Beretta has no intentions of leaving Maryland and what they are saying is absolutely false."<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Manchin's statement was issued at the dedication of a public shooting range in West Virginia.  Not only is he attacking the reputation of Beretta USA, but he is also opening himself up to a libel suit for the damage to Beretta USA.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">While Manchin sounds confident about Beretta not leaving, that is not how the company has responded.  In fact, <a href="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/jeff-reh-testimony.pdf" target="_blank">Jeff Reh</a>, a member of the Board of Directors for Beretta U.S.A. Corp., located in Accokeek, Maryland, told the Maryland lawmakers, "Enact such measures at your own risk."<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">"I think they thought we were bluffing" in the 1990s, Reh <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/02/beretta-to-gun-grabbers-enact-such-measures-at-your-own-risk/" target="_blank">said</a>. "But Berettas don't bluff."<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">In either case, it does make one wonder how the State of West Virginia can continue to keep Joe Manchin in office.  He is clearly a man who stands against the Second Amendment, and a very arrogant man at that.  I'd personally like to see Beretta take him to task over this little interview and sue him for all the money that Michael Bloomberg gave him and then some.</span></p>

<p>What are human workers going to do when super-intelligent robots and computers are better than us at doing <strong>everything</strong>?  That is one of the questions that a <a href="http://www.futuretech.ox.ac.uk/sites/futuretech.ox.ac.uk/files/The_Future_of_Employment_OMS_Working_Paper_1.pdf" title="new study" target="_blank"><strong>new study</strong></a> by Dr. Carl Frey and Dr. Michael Osborne of Oxford University sought to address, and what they concluded was that 47 percent of all U.S. jobs could be automated within the next 20 years.  Considering the fact that the percentage of the U.S. population that is employed is already <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-number-of-private-sector-jobs-fell-by-278000-last-month-but-the-economy-is-getting-better" title="far lower than it was a decade ago"><strong>far lower than it was a decade ago</strong></a>, it is frightening to think that tens of millions more jobs could disappear due to technological advances over the next couple of decades.  I have written <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/category/trade" title="extensively"><strong>extensively</strong></a> about how we are already losing millions of jobs to super cheap labor on the other side of the globe.  What are middle class families going to do as technology also takes away huge numbers of our jobs at an ever increasing pace?  We live during a period of history when knowledge is increasing an an exponential rate.  In the past, when human workers were displaced by technology it also created new kinds of jobs that the world had never seen before.  But what happens when the day arrives when computers and robots can do almost everything more cheaply and more efficiently than humans can?
</p>
<p>For employers, there are a whole host of advantages that come with replacing human workers with technology.  Robots and computers never complain, they never get tired, they never need vacation, they never show up late, they never waste time on Facebook, they don't need any health benefits and there are a vast array of rules, regulations and taxes that you must deal with when you hire a human worker.
</p>
<p>If you could get a task done more cheaply and more efficiently by replacing a human worker with technology, why wouldn't you want to do it?
</p>
<p>We are already starting to see this happen on a mass scale, and according to Dr. Frey and Dr. Osborne, close to half of all of our jobs could be automated within the next 20 years.  A recent article posted on <a href="http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/bulletin/half-of-all-us-jobs-will-be-automated-but-what-opportunities-will-be-created/29406" title="smartplanet.com" target="_blank"><strong>smartplanet.com</strong></a> described how this process might play out...
</p>
<p><em>The automation of half the nation's jobs will occur in two phases, the study says: The first wave will affect (and is affecting) jobs in transportation/logistics, production labor, administrative support, services, sales, and construction. The second wave — propelled by artificial intelligence — will affect jobs in management, science, engineering, and the arts.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Just as interesting as the study is the response provided by Gary Reber, founder and executive director of <a href="http://www.foreconomicjustice.org/" title="For Economic Justice" target="_hplink"><strong>For Economic Justice</strong></a>, who argues that owners of the means of production will actually thrive as such a shift takes place. Those who rely on 9-to-5 standard employment arrangements for subsistence are likely to suffer the most in the automation wave. As Reber put it: 'Full employment is not an objective of businesses. Companies strive to keep labor input and other costs at a minimum."<br />
</em></p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why the U.S. economy will never produce enough jobs for everyone ever again.
</p>
<p>If technology can outperform humans, it is only rational for companies to replace humans with technology.
</p>
<p>And this is even starting to happen in fields that require very high levels of education.
</p>
<p>Just look at what is happening in the medical field.  Today, millions of people turn to websites such as <a href="http://www.webmd.com/" title="WebMD" target="_blank"><strong>WebMD</strong></a> for their medical needs, but this is only just the beginning.  Check out this excerpt from a recent Bloomberg article entitled "<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-26/doctor-robot-will-see-you-shortly.html" title="Doctor Robot Will See You Shortly" target="_blank"><strong>Doctor Robot Will See You Shortly</strong></a>"...
</p>
<p><em>Johnson &amp; Johnson <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/09/26/jjs-sedasys-puts-challenge-to-anesthesiologists/" title="proposes to replace" target="_blank"><strong>proposes to replace</strong></a> anesthesiologists during simple procedures such as colonoscopies -- not with nurse practitioners, but with machines. Sedasys, which dispenses propofol and monitors a patient automatically, was recently approved for use in healthy adult patients who have no particular risk of complications. Johnson &amp; Johnson will lease the machines to doctor's offices for $150 per procedure -- cleverly set well below the $600 to $2,000 that anesthesiologists usually charge.<br />
</em></p>
<p>Certainly we will always need doctors.
</p>
<p>But many of the tasks that doctors once performed will now be performed by technology.
</p>
<p>For example, have you heard about "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/x-prize-foundation/exponential-health-techno_b_3991485.html" title="OnStar for the Body" target="_blank"><strong>OnStar for the Body</strong></a>" yet?  Some of these new "wearable technologies" are more than a little bit creepy...
</p>
<p><em>Smart, cheaper and point-of-care sensors, such as those being developed for the <a href="http://www.nokiasensingxchallenge.org/" title="Nokia Sensing XCHALLENGE" target="_blank"><strong>Nokia Sensing XCHALLENGE</strong></a>, will further enable the 'Digital Checkup' from anywhere. The world of 'Quantified Self' and 'Quantified Health' will lead to a new generation of wearable technologies partnered with <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/watson_in_healthcare.shtml" title="Artificial Intelligence" target="_blank"><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></a> that will help decipher and make this information actionable.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>And this 'actionability' is key. We hear the term Big Data used in various contexts; when applied to health information it will likely be the smart integration of massive data sets from the 'Internet of things' with the small data about your activity, mood, and other information. When properly filtered, this data set can give insights on a macro level - population health - and micro - '<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BhbMPKcOnY" title="OnStar for the Body" target="_blank"><strong>OnStar for the Body</strong></a>' with a personalized 'check engine light' to help identify individual problems before they further develop into expensive, difficult-to-treat or fatal conditions.<br />
</em></p>
<p>We are also seeing humans being replaced in other fields as well.  For instance, <a href="http://fcw.com/articles/2013/09/26/6-sci-fi-darpa-projects.aspx" title="DARPA" target="_blank"><strong>DARPA</strong></a> has developed a robot named "Atlas" that it hopes will be used in "disaster-response scenarios"...
</p>
<p><em>DARPA's Virtual Robotics Challenge entered a new phase in July, when Atlas — a 6-foot-2-inch, 330-pound robot developed by Boston Dynamics — was introduced to seven teams tasked with training it for disaster-response scenarios. The end goal? "Supervised autonomy" so that Atlas and its successors can step into situations too dangerous for humans.<br />
</em></p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Rise-Of-The-Droids-Will-Robots-Eventually-Steal-All-Of-Our-Jobs.jpg"><img src="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Rise-Of-The-Droids-Will-Robots-Eventually-Steal-All-Of-Our-Jobs-300x225.jpg" alt="Rise-Of-The-Droids-Will-Robots-Eventually-Steal-All-Of-Our-Jobs" width="300" height="225" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12264" /></a>I don't know about you, but I don't really want "Terminator" to show up when my family is in the middle of a disaster, but this is where things are headed.
</p>
<p>And as technology increases, a lot of good paying middle class jobs are going to be vulnerable.  In fact, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/practically-human-smart-machines-job-052642993--finance.html" title="recent study of employment data" target="_blank"><strong>one study of employment data</strong></a> that examined statistics from 20 countries found that "almost all the jobs disappearing are in industries that pay middle-class wages, ranging from $38,000 to $68,000."
</p>
<p>Those are exactly the sort of "breadwinner jobs" that middle class families <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-decline-of-breadwinner-jobs-has-resulted-in-the-longest-bread-lines-in-american-history" title="rely upon"><strong>rely upon</strong></a>.
</p>
<p>And of course working class jobs are being replaced by technology as well.  According to <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/509296/small-factories-give-baxter-the-robot-a-cautious-once-over/?utm_campaign=newsletters&amp;utm_source=newsletter-weekly-business&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20130118" title="MIT Technology Review" target="_blank"><strong>MIT Technology Review</strong></a>, a $22,000 humanoid robot named Baxter has been developed that can easily be programmed to do jobs that have never been automated before...
</p>
<p><em>Brooks's company, Rethink Robotics, says the robot will spark a "renaissance" in American manufacturing by helping small companies compete against low-wage offshore labor. Baxter will do that by accelerating a trend of factory efficiency that's eliminated more jobs in the U.S. than overseas competition has. Of the approximately 5.8 million manufacturing jobs the U.S. lost between 2000 and 2010, according to McKinsey Global Institute, two-thirds were lost because of higher productivity and only 20 percent moved to places like China, Mexico, or Thailand.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>The ultimate goal is for robots like Baxter to take over more complex tasks, such as fitting together parts on an electronics assembly line. "A couple more ticks of Moore's Law and you've got automation that works more cheaply than Chinese labor does," Andrew McAfee, an MIT researcher, predicted last year at a conference in Tucson, Arizona, where Baxter was discussed.<br />
</em></p>
<p>So what are human workers going to do when robots are making all of our products?
</p>
<p>That is a very good question.
</p>
<p>Incredibly, robots are now even replacing human factory workers in China.  The following comes from a recent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/foxconn-allegedly-replacing-human-workers-with-robots/?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed" title="TechCrunch article" target="_blank"><strong>TechCrunch article</strong></a>...
</p>
<p><em>Foxconn <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/01/foxconn-planning-to-hire-1-million-robots/" title="has been planning to buy 1 million robots" target="_blank"><strong>has been planning to buy 1 million robots</strong></a> to replace human workers and it looks like that change, albeit gradual, is about to start.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>The company is allegedly paying $25,000 per robot – about three times a worker's average salary – and they will replace humans in assembly tasks. The plans have been in place for a while – I spoke to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/future-of-foxconn/" title="Foxconn reps about this a year ago" target="_blank"><strong>Foxconn reps about this a year ago</strong></a> – and it makes perfect sense. Humans are messy, they want more money, and having a half-a-million of them in one factory is a recipe for unrest. But what happens after the halls are clear of careful young men and women and instead full of whirring robots?<br />
</em></p>
<p>So who benefits from all of this?
</p>
<p>Those that own the big corporations that dominate our economy certainly benefit.  They aren't going to need to hire as many of us to work for them, and they are going to make even bigger profits than before.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-u-s-has-an-even-larger-gap-between-the-rich-and-the-poor-than-downton-abbey-does" title="gap between the rich and the poor"><strong>gap between the wealthy and the poor</strong></a> will grow even larger.  The only thing that most people have to offer in the economic marketplace is their labor, and the demand for that labor is decreasing with each passing day.
</p>
<p>What do you think will happen to society when most of us are no longer "needed"?
</p>
<p>Could we be headed for big trouble as a society?
</p>
<p>And if you think that your job could "never be automated", you might want to think again.
</p>
<p>We are rapidly getting to the point <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323808204579085271065923340.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories" title="where even driving will be automated" target="_blank"><strong>where even driving will be automated</strong></a>...
</p>
<p><em>Brace yourself. In a few years, your car will be able to drop you off at the door of a shopping center or airport terminal, go park itself and return when summoned with a smartphone app. Audi demonstrated such a system at this year's Consumer Electronics Show.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>At your next dinner party, ask for a show of hands of the people who'd want that.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Everybody?<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Anybody want a car that doesn't crash? At this month's Frankfurt auto show, mega-auto supplier Continental announced a partnership with IBM to help bring autonomous vehicles to market, with "zero accidents" as a possible result. Volvo has promised to injury-proof its cars by 2020. GM and Carnegie Mellon aim to develop autonomous technology to eliminate car accidents.<br />
</em></p>
<p>So what will happen to the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/practically-human-smart-machines-job-052642993--finance.html" title="3.1 million Americans" target="_blank"><strong>3.1 million Americans</strong></a> that drive trucks for a living once all driving is automated?
</p>
<p>What will happen to the millions of other Americans that drive buses, taxis and limos once all driving is automated?
</p>
<p>That is something to think about.
</p>
<p>And researchers are even trying to create computers that <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/economics/2013/09/man-who-wants-total-unemployment-all-human-beings-world" title="&quot;seem human&quot;" target="_blank"><strong>"seem human"</strong></a> when you have a conversation with them...
</p>
<p><em>On 14 September, researchers will <a href="http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html" title="gathered in Derry, Northern Ireland" target="_blank"><strong>gathered in Derry, Northern Ireland</strong></a>, to demonstrate their latest efforts. If any of them has created a machine that successfully mimics a human, they will leave $100,000 richer.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>The money is being put up by Hugh Loebner, a New York based philanthropist. His goal, he says, is total unemployment for all human beings throughout the world. He wants robots to do all the work. And the first step towards that is apparently to develop computers that seem human when you chat to them.<br />
</em></p>
<p>So if your job involves a telephone, you are in danger of being phased out.  In fact, this transition is <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569573-attractions-employing-robots-rise-software-machines" title="talking to a robot" target="_blank"><strong>already starting to happen</strong></a>...
</p>
<p><em>IPsoft is a young company started by Chetan Dube, a former mathematics professor at New York University. He reckons that artificial intelligence can take over most of the routine information-technology and business-process tasks currently performed by workers in offshore locations. "The last decade was about replacing labour with cheaper labour," says Mr Dube. "The coming decade will be about replacing cheaper labour with autonomics."<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>IPsoft's Eliza, a "virtual service-desk employee" that learns on the job and can reply to e-mail, answer phone calls and hold conversations, is being tested by several multinationals. At one American media giant she is answering 62,000 calls a month from the firm's information-technology staff. She is able to solve two out of three of the problems without human help. At IPsoft's media-industry customer Eliza has replaced India's Tata Consulting Services.<br />
</em></p>
<p>We truly are entering an unprecedented time in human history.
</p>
<p>Instead of robots violently taking over society like so many movies have portrayed, they are slowly starting to "replace" us instead.  A recent <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/12/ff-robots-will-take-our-jobs/all/" title="Wired article" target="_blank"><strong>Wired article</strong></a> described what this transition might look like as it picks up steam...
</p>
<p><em>First, machines will consolidate their gains in already-automated industries. After robots finish replacing assembly line workers, they will replace the workers in warehouses. Speedy bots able to lift 150 pounds all day long will retrieve boxes, sort them, and load them onto trucks. Fruit and vegetable picking will continue to be robotized until no humans pick outside of specialty farms. Pharmacies will feature a single pill-dispensing robot in the back while the pharmacists focus on patient consulting. Next, the more dexterous chores of cleaning in offices and schools will be taken over by late-night robots, starting with easy-to-do floors and windows and eventually getting to toilets. The highway legs of long-haul trucking routes will be driven by robots embedded in truck cabs.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>All the while, robots will continue their migration into white-collar work. We already have artificial intelligence in many of our machines; we just don't call it that. Witness one piece of software by Narrative Science (profiled in issue 20.05) that can write newspaper stories about sports games directly from the games' stats or generate a synopsis of a company's stock performance each day from bits of text around the web. Any job dealing with reams of paperwork will be taken over by bots, including much of medicine. Even those areas of medicine not defined by paperwork, such as surgery, are becoming increasingly robotic. The rote tasks of any information-intensive job can be automated. It doesn't matter if you are a doctor, lawyer, architect, reporter, or even programmer: The robot takeover will be epic.<br />
</em></p>
<p>Are you ready for the "robot takeover"?
</p>
<p>The world of employment is never going to be the same again.  Technology has already surpassed human workers in a whole host of arenas, and this transition is only going to become more rapid in the years ahead.
</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the rest of us?</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">In American society, family outings are civilized, morally-based and typically do not include criminality.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">In fact, my family activities range from visiting places of interest, having barbecues in the park, or simply playing board games at a relative's home. However, there are families who evidently do not adhere to the basic, good-natured, principles that govern the rest of us. Consequently, their societal detachment continuously yields mind-boggling stories such as the following.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">According to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/09/family-caught-selling-stolen-church-goods-in-front-yard/" target="_blank"><strong>ABC News</strong></a>, a family of heathens was arrested for stealing items in two separate burglaries from a nearby church. The family then had yard sales to peddle the merchandise, which included electronics, generators, music equipment, and water coolers. Undeniably, this family of three is the" Un-Holy Trinity."<br />
</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_12257" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 618px"><a href="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ht_church_robbery_jtm_130926_16x9_608.jpg"><img src="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ht_church_robbery_jtm_130926_16x9_608.jpg" alt="Olivia Jones (Daughter), Paul Mikell (Father), and Clariese Jones (Mother)" width="608" height="342" class="size-full wp-image-12257" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Olivia Jones (Daughter), Paul Mikell (Father), and Clariese Jones (Mother)</p></div>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">During the burglaries, the father (Paul Mikell) would wait inside the getaway vehicle, while the mother (Clariese Jones) and their daughter (Olivia Jones) robbed the church.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Acting on an anonymous tip, which assumingly came from a person who knew that hell was hot, the police arrived at the heathen's home (a few streets from the church) and immediately noticed several speakers, a CD player, and other electronics on the front lawn.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">The police stated that the daughter (Olivia Jones) was once jailed on unrelated charges stemming from a traffic violation. Her incarceration occurred between the two church burglary incidents, and  her mother, father, along with another heathen, identified only as Beaux, sold several of the stolen items from the first burglary for Olivia's bail.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Unsurprisingly, after Olivia was released from jail, the family resumed their favorite family pastime and burglarized the church again.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Currently, this treacherous trio is in jail for simple burglary of a religious building.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Even so, the mom and daughter still had the audacity to smile for their mug shot photos. Perhaps they're smiling because the joke is on us.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Yup, the taxpayers will now be robbed to pay for this family's jail stay.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Maybe, just maybe, this entire situation could have been prevented if this family pondered the popular phrase, "What Would Jesus Do?" instead of "What Would Lucifer Do?"<br />

<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">As I write this, it appears that the federal government is about to shut down because the House and Senate cannot agree on whether to add language defunding or delaying Obamacare to the "Continuing Resolution". Despite all the hand-wringing heard in DC<strong>, a short-term government shut down (which doesn't actually shut down the government) will not cause the country to collapse.<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">And the American people would benefit if Obamacare was defeated or even delayed.<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt"><em>Obamacare saddles the American health care system with new spending and mandates which will raise the price and lower the quality of health care. Denying funds to this program may give Congress time to replace this bill with free-market reforms that put patients and physicians back in charge of health care. Defunding the bill before it becomes implemented can spare the American people from falling under the worst effects of this law.<br />
</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">As heartened as we should be by the fight against Obamacare, we should be equally disheartened by the fact that so few in DC are talking about making real cuts in federal spending. Even fewer are talking about reductions in the most logical place to reduce spending: the military-industrial complex.  The US military budget constitutes almost 50 percent of the total worldwide military spending.  Yet to listen to some in Congress, one would think that America was one canceled multi-million dollar helicopter contract away from being left totally defenseless.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">What makes this military spending impossible to justify is that is does not benefit the American people. Instead, by fomenting resentment and hatred among the world population, our costly interventionist foreign policy makes our people less safe. Thus, reducing spending on militarism would not only help balance the budget, but would enhance our security.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Yet both the House and the Senate continuing resolutions not only fail to reduce military spending, they actually authorize $20 billion more in military spending than authorized by the "sequestration" created by the 2011 Budget Control Act.  Most of the supposedly "draconian" sequestration cuts are not even cuts; instead, they are "reductions in the planed rate of spending." This is where Congress increases spending but by less than originally planned—and yet they claim to cut spending.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Under sequestration, military spending increases by 18 percent instead of by 20 percent over the next ten years. Yet some so-called conservatives are so opposed to these phony cuts in military spending that they would support increased taxes and increased welfare "military" spending. This "grand bargain" would benefit the DC political class and the special interests, but it would be a disaster for the American people.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><br />
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Instead of grand bargains of increased spending and taxes, those of us who support limited government and free markets should form a coalition with antiwar liberals to reduce spending on both the military industrial complex and domestic welfare programs. Instead of raising taxes on "the rich," we should also work to reduce all corporate subsidies. This "grand bargain" would truly be a win-win for the American people.<br />
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:14pt">Sadly, even if a congressional coalition to cut both warfare and welfare spending was formed, it would be unlikely to carry the day as long as the Federal Reserve is willing to enable Congress's debt addiction by monetizing the debt, but this cannot last forever. At some point, the Fed's policies will result in hyper-inflation and an economic crisis that will force Congress to reduce spending. Hopefully, the growing number of Americans who are awaking to the dangers of our current path can convince Congress to reduce overseas militarism and begin an orderly drawdown of the welfare state before this crisis occurs.<br />

Those of us who are fighting this scourge are the bad guys.
</p>
<p>Which is more monstrous: these devout Muslims slaughtering in the cause of Islam or the media's cover-up of the motive? No media are reporting this, with just a few exceptions. They are portraying the jihadists as thrill-seeking youth pursuing <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/08/al-shabaab-recruiting-jihadists-in-minnesota/" target="_self">"the real Disneyland" of African jihad.</a> They refer to these savages as "militants" and "gunmen."
</p>
<p>Think of it. The <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2013/09/media-self-enforces-sharia-islam-muslim-jihad-censored-from-90-of-newspaper-reports-on-kenya-pakista.html">media are self-enforcing Shariah: "Islam," "Muslim" and "jihad" have been censored from 90 percent of newspaper reports on the Kenya and Pakistan attacks</a>, despite the murderers' exhortations.
</p>
<p>Stunning. Imagine omitting "Nazi," "Third Reich," etc., from press accounts of World War II. This is civilizational suicide. We are covering for our executioners. And if anyone thinks that this appeases or satiates the enemy, they are delusional. This empowers them – the sanction of the victim.
</p>
<p>Under the blasphemy laws under the Shariah (Islamic law), you cannot criticize Islam. You cannot say anything that would offend a Muslim (even if it's true). This is Shariah in America.
</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/6a00d8341c60bf53ef019aff8bf0f3970b-500wi.jpg"><img src="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/6a00d8341c60bf53ef019aff8bf0f3970b-500wi-300x200.jpg" alt="6a00d8341c60bf53ef019aff8bf0f3970b-500wi" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12250" /></a><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/10333477/After-Kenya-no-more-turning-the-other-cheek-to-those-who-hate-us.html">The Telegraph</a> declared in a headline Friday, "After Kenya, no more turning the other cheek to those who hate us."<strong> </strong>Really? The cheek has already turned. And this declaration is posted in a U.K. newspaper, a country that banned Robert Spencer and me for speaking against this very thing. I didn't see the Telegraph running editorials or stories in support of our visit. To the contrary, the media were viciously against Robert Spencer and me and published <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2013/07/noisome-times-of-london-article-says-pamela-geller-should-be-allowed-into-uk.html" target="_self">defamation and libel pieces</a> smearing our good name. So forgive my contempt for this half-hearted rebuke to savages. It is the enemedia that has sanctioned and emboldened the jihadists, and continue to do so.
</p>
<p>Allison Pearson of the Telegraph goes on to describe the devout murderers as maniacs. Those maniacs are "martyrs" and are exalted as such in many corners of the Muslim world. One only has to watch "Palestinian" TV to see the daily parade of mass-murderers heralded as heroes and martyrs. Or is that OK because it is Jews whom those Muslims are killing?
</p>
<p>Pearson wants to know: Where is the Muslim condemnation? Oh, it's coming, my dear, and it will be condemning <em>you</em>.
</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, this was a good column, but it was casting pearls before swine in the pigs' own pen.
</p>
<p>And the Hamas-tied Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, which insists that it speaks for American Muslims and claims that it is America's largest "Muslim civil liberties advocacy organization," responds to American Muslims going to Africa to monstrously slaughter non-Muslims by saying, <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2013/09/hamas-cair-who-cares-if-american-muslims-were-waging-jihad-in-kenya-mall-siege.html" target="_self">"<em>Who cares?" </em></a>
	</p>
<p>Who cares? Civilized men care. The dead care. America cares. The victims care. Their families care. Freedom-loving people care. Defenders of freedom care. These are elements in our midst that wish to murder and maim as many infidels as possible in the cause of Islam. <em>We care.</em>
	</p>
<p>The congressional ban that prohibited the FBI from interacting with Hamas-CAIR should be expanded to all law enforcement agencies. We wouldn't want them colluding with al-Qaida, either. It's the same thing.

American Muslims joined a multinational force of Muslims to wage holy war in Kenya. The jihadis attacked <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2013/09/muslim-terrorist-in-kenya-.html" target="_self">American and Jewish shops</a>. <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2013/09/jihad-in-kenya-women-and-children-were-slaughtered-if-they-could-not-recite-the-koran-jihadis-cut-th.html">The jihadis cut the hands off the bodies of their victims and burned their faces.</a> The killers chanted, "Our mujahideen are prepared to die for our cause!"
</p>
<p>Hostages and victims <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2013/09/all-muslims-leave-we-only-want-to-kill-non-muslims-jihadists-massacre-at-least-22-in-kenyan-shopping.html">were told "all Muslims leave … we only want to kill non-Muslims": They released anyone who could prove they were Muslim by reciting a prayer</a>. Women and children were slaughtered if they could not recite the Quran or name the mother of the Prophet Muhammad.
</p>
<p>So why didn't even one Muslim scream out Muhammad's mother's name and give the answer to those being executed?
</p>
<p>We are constantly schooled by Muslims in every media outlet say that these actions do not represent Islam. And yet no Muslim confronted the jihadists in Kenya about their "misunderstanding of Islam."
</p>
<p>And all was taking place as more than 100 Christians were slaughtered in a historic church in Pakistan packed with Sunday worshipers, while 140 were murdered in Muslim attacks on Christians in Nigeria – all on the same day, all in the cause of Islam. While this unimaginable slaughter was taking place, Muslims were marching down Madison Avenue in New York City waving the black flag of jihad.
</p>
<p>All this horror is reminiscent of Muhammad. After the Jewish Banu Quraiza tribe surrendered to Muhammad, Muhammad slaughtered all of the adult men (judged by pubic-hair growth). Their women and children were enslaved and sold.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.islam-watch.org/Larry/Muhammad-Massacres-and-Sex-slaves.htm" target="_self">Islam-Watch</a> reports: </p>
<blockquote><p>"At the Massacre of Khaybar, Muhammad brutally tortured a Jewish chieftain for extracting information about where he had hidden his treasures. When the treasure was uncovered, the chieftain was beheaded. This chieftain was the husband of the most beautiful Jewish woman of Khaybar, the 17-year-old Safiyaah. Safiyaah's family members had been annihilated by Muhammad at the Banu Qurayza massacre. Now having beheaded her husband, the Prophet took Safiyah as his sex-slave and copulated on the same night."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Muhammad, the "perfect example."</strong>
</p>
<p>And then <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-09-24/news/sns-rt-us-usa-kenya-attack-minneapolis-20130924_1_shabaab-backlash-community-activist">Reuters reported</a> last Tuesday that "members of the largest ethnic Somali community in the United States expressed frustration on Tuesday, fearing a backlash after the attack on a Kenya shopping mall by a Somalia-based Islamic group that has recruited fighters in Minnesota."
</p>

This is the second wave of jihad. First murder, and then the victims have to apologize. And the quivering, craven enemedia lap this up like hungry wolves.
</p>
<p>There is a problem, and what are they doing about it? Law-enforcement officials know of at least 20 Somali Muslims who have left Minnesota to join al Shabaab's jihad in Somalia. Some have died there.
</p>
<p>This is a community that has serious problems. The fact is that these Somali Muslims should be addressing them. Where are the protests against jihad? A number of the Kenyan jihadists were allegedly American Muslim<em>s from their community.</em> What are they doing to stop this? Why attack the victims? Attack the motive. <em>Do something!</em> They should be protesting the mosques that teach and preach jihadic doctrines. They should be demanding the closure of mosques that teach and preach jihad. They should be demanding reformation of Islam. They should be standing with my colleagues and me. They should be supporting Rep. Peter King's hearings.
</p>

And still Obama will not designate this group a terrorist group.

<p>Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) appeared on CBS' Face the Nation and told host Bob Schieffer if there is a government shutdown because of a failure to find an agreement on the future of Obamacare, it will be entirely Barack Obama's fault.
</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/WMgkbjp7l8Q?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p>Paul explained the Republicans had moved from their position of full repeal to what they view as compromise in asking for a one year delay, something that is already a part of many aspects of Obamacare.  As a result, they are asking Democrats to compromise.
</p>
<p>"But see, he is saying 100 percent of Obamacare or the highway," Paul said.  "The president is the one saying I will shut down government if you don't give me everything I want on Obamacare. That to me is the president being intransigent and being unwilling to compromise."
</p>
<p>Though Schieffer said that Obamacare had "already been passed," implying that the time for arguing over whether it should be law had passed as well.  It seems he never made that argument when Obama decided not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) or when Obama decided not to enforce immigration laws and his administration told Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents not to enforce immigration laws.  Hypocrisy Bob?
</p>
<p>Paul suggested that the House and Senate leadership come together and hash out the differences.
</p>
<p>"I think there is a way," Paul said with respect to a resolution. "And I have been saying all along that we should negotiate. See, historically Bob, the way it worked is if the House is Republican and passed something and the Senate was Democrat and passed something you had a conference committee, equal number of Republicans and Democrats, and you hashed out your differences. Why don't we have a conference committee on this? You could appoint one today, they could meet tomorrow and hash out the differences. That is the way it is supposed to work. Republicans and Democrats are supposed to find a middle ground but right now, <strong>it is the president saying my way or the highway, if I don't get everything I want, if I don't get Obamacare -- which Democrats passed without any Republican support -- the Democrats are saying they are willing to shut down the government</strong>."
</p>
<p>Frankly, I can remember lots of those little meetings between leadership resulting in nothing good for the American people.  Some of the latest of those little conferences was the fiscal cliff and debt ceiling deals.  To borrow a word that <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/08/chris-matthews-ted-cruz-is-a-terrorist/" target="_blank">Chris Matthews attempted to use against Senator Ted Cruz</a>, You cannot negotiate or compromise with terrorists.  Barack Obama and the Democrats are nothing more than domestic enemies of the Constitution and the American people (and no, I'm not apologizing for saying that).
</p>
<p>However, Paul is right.  Obama and Reid haven't compromised one thing.  They have simply stood their ground and from the beginning Obamacare was rammed through along the Democrat Party line.  Not one Republican voted for it, not one!
<p>Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) appeared behind Paul and attempted to rebut his suggestion of setting up a conference committee to negotiate differences between the resolutions in the House and Senate.
</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/tn0UJevIgy4?feature=player_detailpage" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p>"Conference committees are the normal course of action," Durbin said. "We have been trying for more than six months to get the Senate Republicans to agree to a conference committee on the budget. They refuse a conference committee, when it comes to our budget. When it comes to healthcare reform, there should be an orderly process."
</p>
<p>"But look what we have to work with on the other side," Durbin added. "Almost forty-five times now the House Republicans have voted to abolish ObamaCare, not to change it, not to come up with any specific change. The closest they have come is with this medical device tax. But, if there's to be a constructive conversation about the future of healthcare reform, it's going forward; I fully support that. But let's sit down in a bipartisan and calm way—not with the prospect of shutting down the government or shutting down the economy."
</p>
<p>Frankly, when it comes to funding, that is Congress' job and they can fund or not fund whatever they desire.  That authority is their's per the Constitution.  They also have the ability, due to the balance of powers, to challenge the Affordable Care Act.  There is nothing wrong with that either.
</p>
<p>Democrats are just attempting to apply pressure here.  Those Republicans who believe Obamacare is not only unconstitutional, but simply bad law, should stand their ground.  They shouldn't compromise one inch.  Do they see Democrats compromising?  I don't.  When it comes to that issue, they could learn a lesson from the Democrats and stand on their principles rather than seek to compromise.  Compromise is only good for your adversary.  As Margaret Thatcher once said,
</p>
<blockquote><p>"If you set out to be liked, you would be prepared to compromise on anything at any time, and you would achieve nothing."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…and as Andrew Carnegie adds to that sentiment:
</p>
<blockquote><p>"The 'morality of compromise' sounds contradictory.  Compromise is usually a sign of weakness, or an admission of defeat.  Strong men don't compromise, it is said, and principles should never be compromised."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the mindset of many in the Republican leadership.  They are more concerned with being liked and the media not beating them up than they are with actually achieving what they say their goal is.  My advice to Republicans is, let Obama and the Democrats shut the government down.  Stand your ground and you will be rewarded for it by your constituents.  If you don't stand your ground, you will face your constituents' wrath.</p>

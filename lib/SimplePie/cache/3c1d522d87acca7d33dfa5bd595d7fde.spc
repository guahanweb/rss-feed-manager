Frompovich</a><br /><br />Recently I read an article that had me wondering what are they thinking, anyway.  As a consumer health researcher for over 35 years, I can see a clear childhood diseases history trail in the rear view mirror, as they would say.  <br /><br />One issue that doesn’t seem to sit right with me is the fact that as a young child in the 1940s, who went to both public and parochial schools, I never remember a child dying from any of the childhood communicable diseases, and we lived in a large city. <br /><br />Furthermore, I remember parents holding ‘measles parties’ where they would take their children to the house of a child with measles so their child could contract the disease; get it over with early in life; and acquire natural, life-long immunity. It was a given back then: children got childhood diseases, and we survived.  Just ask anyone who is 60 years or older how it was done.<br /><br />What happened to change that childhood ‘tradition’ of dealing with communicable childhood diseases to the current fear mongering one where parents are mentally bludgeoned to get their children vaccinated against a host of childhood diseases, which, in fact, may be Nature’s way of improving and strengthening the immune system in children, who are not living in squalor or are nutritionally deficient, to acquire innate or “natural immunity.”  Vaccines provide accelerated artificial responses, which vaccinologists consider “acquired immunity” that needs to be boostered every so often with more doses of these vaccines.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br />Granted, in Third World countries where sanitation is lacking; water is not safe, potable, and plentiful; and food and nutrition are compromised, childhood communicable infectious diseases can be devastating.  Resources should be expended for improving the essentials of daily living, and then life would improve for everyone except Big Pharma, which would not make billions of dollars from vaccines that cause adverse events and even death.  See <b><a href="http://vactruth.com/2012/08/12/vaccinations-killing-kids/">Fact: Vaccinations are Killing Our Kids</a></b>.  In addition, such vaccination programs are contributory, if not causal, factors for many of the epidemic levels of chronic childhood medical conditions that were unknown or ‘rare’ before vaccines were introduced.<br /><br />The article that prompted my writing this was discussing “Extra doses of mumps vaccine during outbreaks still in question” wherein this was stated:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Administering additional doses of vaccine may not be the optimal solution to a mumps     outbreak, according to study data published online. [1]</blockquote>That remark revolved around this issue:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">CDC researchers reported data on 2,503 sixth- through 12th-grade students from three     schools in an Orthodox Jewish community in Orange County, N.Y., where a mumps       <a href="http://www.healio.com/pediatrics/vaccine-preventable-diseases/news/online/%7B1e3dd747-a903-4920-b665-29fcb42ce6ec%7D/possible-mumps-outbreak-reported-in-nj">outbreak</a> occurred in 2009. All of the students had documented two doses of mumps- containing <a href="http://www.healio.com/pediatrics/vaccine-preventable-diseases/news/online/%7B3bd7f4d5-1074-4f54-b653-31f919c806b0%7D/mmr-booster-failed-to-increase-jia-disease-activity-in-children">vaccine</a>. A total of 320 vaccinated children developed mumps. [2]</blockquote>What really struck me about the mumps vaccine issue is my remembering that the mumps vaccine manufactured by Merck &amp; Company was reported to be not effective, and two <i>qui tam</i> plaintiffs filed a civil action on behalf of the federal government, Civil Action No. 10-4374, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania filed August 27, 2010.  Part of the filings included<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>The original 95 percent efficacy rate for Merck’s mumps vaccine was based upon      the 1967 filing for governmental approval.</b></blockquote><a href="http://activistpost.net/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MkKSFqq5-DE/TfAbRwTtoXI/AAAAAAAAJRE/itK2KofpgVU/VACCINE-BANNER.gif" /></a>Can you imagine that? And, Merck has been contending that its MMRII vaccine was 95 percent ‘effective’ (efficacy level) since at least the year 2000.  Furthermore, the complaint charges that Merck listed that false information in the FDA-approved vaccine package inserts which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Vaccine Program relied upon as accurate information to promote this vaccine to health agencies.  The information for the mumps component was not scientifically accurate, nor was Merck able to produce that 95 percent effectiveness level using the accepted vaccine certification practices upon which the FDA relied.  <br /><br />The Orange County, N.Y., mumps outbreak occurred in 2009.  Was that outbreak a result of children receiving non-effective mumps vaccines, since 320 children who contracted mumps were doubly vaccinated?  That 2009 Orange County, N.Y., mumps outbreak, at least, was not said to be caused by non-vaccinated children, which normally is the stock reason given by the media for infectious disease outbreaks.<br /><br />The above illustrates that there are too many unknowns revolving around vaccines, some of which are not discovered until years after vaccinations are given, such as the SV40 cancer causing virus in the polio vaccines given in the 1950s and ‘60s.  Plus, other viruses in various vaccines, which I discuss in my forthcoming book, <i><b>Vaccination Voodoo, What YOU Don’t Know About Vaccines</b></i>, which will appear on Amazon.com soon. <br /><br /><b>Screening Children for Possible Contraindications to Vaccines</b><br /><br />One possible way to preclude some unknowns, especially with regard to possible adverse reactions or contraindications, would be for parents and guardians to answer a screening checklist they can print out from <a href="http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4066.pdf">Immunization Action Coalition</a>, and give that completed form to the healthcare professional who will be administering the vaccines BEFORE any vaccinations are given.  Make certain to keep a photocopy for your records—just in case there could be a problem and you find yourself filing a claim before the an administrative ‘vaccine court’ master.  Also, always remember to obtain the manufacturer and vaccine names, plus the batch number of any vaccines given to you or your children.<br /><br /><i>The Screening Checklist for Contraindications to Vaccines for Children and Teens </i>asks a dozen questions that every vaccine administrator should be asking before vaccinating to determine if the child is well enough, or is a safe candidate, to receive vaccines.  <br /><br />Some of the questions asked should raise red flags for the physician, nurse, or vaccine administrator, such as:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">#1.  Is the child sick today?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">#3.  Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">#6.  If your child is a baby, have you ever been told he or she has had intussusception?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">#7.  Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the child had brain or other nervous system problems?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">#11. Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a chance she could become pregnant during the next month?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">#12. Has the child received vaccinations in the past 4 weeks?</blockquote>The six questions not listed above are lengthy and involved, but very “telling” insofar as a “yes” answer should get special attention and probably delay or provide a medical exemption from receiving vaccines.<br /><br /><b>Now on to Influenza Vaccines.</b><br /><br />Autumnal chill is in the air and everywhere you look, one sees signs indicating “Flu Shots Here.”  What most folks don’t realize is that flu vaccines are not very effective. Even the CDC said in February 2013 that the flu shot was 9 percent effective for those over 65!  This CDC website gives the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6207a2.htm?s_cid=mm6207a2_w">February 2013 Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Rates for the USA</a>.<br /><br />So, here’s information that everyone needs to know, I think, before considering an annual flu vaccination, especially for this 2013-14 season when there are quadrivalent—4 actives in a vaccine—influenza vaccines.<br /><div><br />Information about vaccines needs to be from independent, non-vested-interests.  <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/about-us">The Cochrane Collaboration</a> fills that requirement, <i>par excellence, </i>I believe.   Since more than 200 viruses can cause influenza or influenza-like symptoms/sicknesses,<i> w</i>hat protection does a vaccine containing only 4 virus actives provide?<br /><br />According to Cochrane, <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">At best, vaccines might be effective against only influenza A and B, which            represent about 10% of all circulating viruses. [3]</blockquote>With that in mind, maybe readers will want to check out <a href="http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/details/collection/978807/Influenza-evidence-from-Cochrane-Reviews.html">The Cochrane Library</a> for a wealth of information on influenza, prevention, treatment, and Chinese medicinal herbs for treatment of the flu.<br /><br /><b>No-Thimerosal Influenza Vaccine Guide</b><br /><br />However, for those who believe in vaccinations, Dr. Paul G King, PhD, created the <b><a href="http://mercury-freedrugs.org/docs/130906_No_ThimerosalInfluenzaVaccineChoicesForThe2013_2014FluSeason_final_br2.pdf"><i>Guide to No-Thimerosal Influenza Vaccine Choices in the USA for the 2013-2014 Flu Season</i></a>.</b><br /><br /><a href="http://activistpost.net/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N2GOFRKd8Vs/UF4PWWZ5dsI/AAAAAAAARz4/tuwcrewmlWA/s316/herbalcures.png" style="background-image: none; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: none;" width="160" /></a>Carefully study page 4 or T-1 because of all the variables involved, which an individual may want to contemplate considering all the ingredients in vaccines, especially if the person is pregnant, or if the vaccine contains a “live” virus, which can shed.  Perhaps, you are allergic to eggs, so vaccines made on chicken eggs is important information to know.<br /><br />Dr. King does a yeoman’s job of delineating all the USA influenza vaccines for 2013-14.  <br /><br />Perhaps, the best course of action readers can take to prepare for the coming flu season is to get a handle on your vitamin A, C, and D intake.  Check out the herb Echinacea to build up the immune system, and eat nutritiously: no GMOs and as much organically-grown food as possible.<br /><br />Hydration is important, including herbal teas.  Cut down or eliminate junk foods and soda.  Get plenty of sleep.  And, get in the habit of washing hands several times a day with pure soap and warm water, especially before putting any food or drink into your mouth or touching your face.<br /><br />Pretty soon it’s going to be sniffle time.  Don’t you want to be ready?<br /><br /><b>Notes:</b><br />[1] <a href="http://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/vaccine-preventable-diseases/news/online/%7B6b9a4cf9-448e-4d48-808c-29492a41202e%7D/extra-doses-of-mumps-vaccine-during-outbreaks-still-in-question">http://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/vaccine-preventable-diseases/news/online/%7B6b9a4cf9-448e-4d48-808c-29492a41202e%7D/extra-doses-of-mumps-vaccine-during-outbreaks-still-in-question</a><br /><br />[2] Ibid.<br /><br />[3] <a href="http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD001269/vaccines-to-prevent-influenza-in-healthy-adults">http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD001269/vaccines-to-prevent-influenza-in-healthy-adults</a><br /><br /></div><i>Catherine J Frompovich (<a href="http://www.catherinejfrompovich.com/">website</a>) is a retired natural nutritionist who earned advanced degrees in Nutrition and Holistic Health Sciences, Certification in Orthomolecular Theory and Practice plus Paralegal Studies.<br /><br />Her work has been published in national and airline magazines since the early 1980s.

It was the only source of heat in a place that reached -42 degrees.  It was the only way we could cook when our power went out during snow and ice storms (as it did frequently).  It was the cozy center of our home, and we survived for an entire frigid winter for less than $800. After that experience I vowed never to live in a home without a wood stove.<br /><br />If the EPA has its way, however, heating your home self-sufficiently with wood could soon become illegal – or at the very least, insanely expensive.<br /><br /><a href="http://offgridsurvival.com/epa-woodburningstoves-illegal/">Off Grid Survival</a> reports:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Shortly after the re-election of President Obama, the agency announced new radical environmental regulations that threaten to affect people who live off the grid. The EPA’s new environmental regulations reduce the amount of airborne fine-particle matter from 15 micrograms to 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">This means that most wood burning stoves would now fall into a class that would deemed unacceptable under these new draconian measures. The EPA has even launched a nifty new website called <a href="http://www.epa.gov/burnwise/">Burn Wise</a> to try to sway public opinion.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">On their site, while trying to convince people to get rid of their old stoves and buy the new EPA-certified stoves, they state that these older stove must be scrapped and cannot be resold.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>From the EPA Site:&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>The local air pollution agency says I can’t sell my old wood stove to help pay for an EPA-certified wood stove.  Why is that?&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Replacing an older stove with a cleaner-burning stove will not improve air quality if the older stove is reused somewhere else.  For this reason, wood stove change out programs usually require older stoves to be destroyed and recycled as scrap metal, or rendered inoperable.

If you have a mortgage, you have absolutely no option but to carry homeowner’s insurance.  Even if you own you homestead outright, most people consider insuring their homes and property to be a vital safety net. When your policy comes up for annual renewal, the insurance company can require an inspection of your home. At that time, compliance can easily be forced by either charging insanely high rates or through the cancellation of the policies of those who have “outdated” wood stoves.<br /><br /><b>An Attack on Self-Sufficient Living</b><br /><br />The ability to heat your home off-grid is a major part of most preparedness plans.  Heating with wood is the number one way to do this.  Much like<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/how-many-buckets-of-freedom-do-you-have-02252013"> our food supplies</a>, the ability to keep ourselves warm and healthy and the ability to cook without being connected to the grid are vital to our freedom.<br /><br />Those of us who live this lifestyle are constantly targeted. In many places it’s illegal to collect rainwater.  Growing food in your front yard instead of flowers is all but outlawed.  Sellers of raw milk have their farms raided by SWAT teams as though they’re running a meth lab instead of a dairy. We are being <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/codex-alimentarius-an-introduction-to-soft-kill-eugenics-2-12102012">Codex Alimentarius-ed</a> and Agenda 21-ed right into slavery and the government and its agencies try to make it appear that they are “saving” us.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-S6RfjP7Lvo8/USlEmRqWjJI/AAAAAAAAUgk/Zio_5z2T_gE/s200/prep.gif" /></a>We, the self-sufficient, by our very nature, are a threat to this insidiously spreading control. Our self-sufficiency means that we won’t be forced to be subjugated, tagged, chipped, and inventoried like our less prepared friends and neighbors.  We won’t have to cave in order to survive. We can eat, stay warm, and stay off the radar.  And this is a threat because we can withstand the assaults on our freedom.  We don’t need<a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/watch-american-dependency-give-me-my-food-stamps_09202013"> the government’s benevolence to survive</a>. Those of us who don’t need the government are the last hold-outs of liberty in a country that has strayed far from it’s freedom-loving origins.<br /><br /><b>The “Credibility” of the EPA</b><br /><br />Don’t be fooled by environmental friendliness or the warm and fuzzy green words.  The EPA is just another tool of subjugation.  Their stamp of approval carries the same “credibility” as that of  USDA or FDA approval. The Environmental Protection Agency, that bastion of clean air and fertile land, wants you to believe that they are taking steps to save us all.<br /><br />You know, the same folks who <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/despite-irrefutable-evidence-of-toxicity-and-death-monsantos-friends-at-the-epa-raise-allowable-glysophate-levels-06192013">upped the legal levels of glyphosate for their friends at Monsanto</a>, even though the herbicide has been proven to cause toxicity and death. The same <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/pardon-me-your-food-is-glowing-04122012">agency that responded quickly when radiation</a> from the Fukushima disaster reached dangerous levels on the shores of California by closing down 8 of their 18 radiation-testing facilities in California and increasing the “safe amounts” of radiation that we can absorb.<br /><br />The EPA (or as I like to call it, the <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/the-environmental-deception-agency-04152012">Environmental Deception Agency</a>) tends to  find things to be highly threatening to the environment only when those things allow us to be non-reliant on big business.<br /><br />One controversy after another can be attributed to the EPA, an agency charged with protecting the air we breathe, the soil in which we grow our food and the water that we drink.  At the bottom of each of those controversies can be found ties to the conspiracies of the big businesses that really run the country.  Decisions are being auctioned off to industry lobbyists with the most money and influence.<br /><br />Environmental protection is only the rule of thumb if it goes along with <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/agenda-21-full-spectrum-domination-02282012">Agenda 21</a> – the EPA is all over <a href="http://www.epa.gov/owow/NPS/ordinance/mol3.htm">the green agenda</a> in cases that benefit the redistribution of wealth, but the agency completely ignores blatant crimes against the earth if it involves fracking for the benefit of a natural gas company or poisoning the soil and groundwater for the benefit of a biotech monolith.<br /><br /><i>Daisy Luther is a freelance writer and editor.

In 2008, they formed an organization named “the Congress of Professionals for Suppressing Uterine Cervical Cancer” to further promote this recommendation.<br /><br />HPV vaccination programs began in 2010 under a recommendation made by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (JMHLW) to administer HPV vaccines to girls from 11 to 14 years old. The Japanese government allocated 15 billion yen (187.5 million dollars) for urgent HPV Vaccination programs. As HPV vaccination was voluntary and not yet mandatory, local governments eagerly recommended the vaccination. Officials visited junior high schools to advocate the effectiveness of the vaccine and persuade students to be vaccinated. They also stressed that the expensive vaccination (48,000 yen, $600, for three shots) would be free within the 2 year limit. Municipal offices sent letters to families which had girls of the targeted age group to urge vaccination.<br /><br />Japan Medical Association and Japan Pediatrics Association supported HPV vaccination program. From the end of 2012 to Feb. 15 2013, JMA conducted a signature-collecting campaign for a petition to urge the addition of seven vaccinations (HB, PCV7, PCV23, Hib, HPV, chicken pox, mumps) to the list of mandatory ones.<br /><br />After discussions in the Japanese parliaments, it was decided to add three vaccinations (HPV, Hib and PCV7) to the mandatory ones on Mar 28 2013. There was no political party which stated an opinion opposing the addition of HPV vaccines.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br />March 11 2011, huge earthquakes and tsunami attacked the north-eastern area of Honshu island of Japan, and atomic power plant in Fukushima lost external power supply and lost the means to cool reactor cores.<br /><br />Aftershocks hit repeatedly. The biggest one was during the night of April 7. Nuclear power plants in Fukushima blew up by hydrogen explosion on Mar 12 and 14.<br /><br />In the midst of this turmoil, a non-commercial video made by Advertising Council Japan was broadcasted on TV repeatedly and repeatedly. In that video, an actress known to have recovered from uterine cervical cancer and her daughter stressed the importance of cervical cancer checkups. Two or three months later, this video program was replaced with HPV vaccine promotion video programs of Cervarix (GSK K.K.) and Gardasil (MSD K.K.).<br /><br />Up to today, 3.28 million girls, including adult women, were vaccinated with HPV vaccine. Total dose is estimated as 8.64 million. The figure below shows the transition of vaccination count reported to JMLHW from local governments. The population of Japanese girls age 11 is, for example, 580,000. March is the last month of the academic year.<br /><div style="color: #444444; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; padding: 0px 0px 15px;">&nbsp;<a href="http://sanevax.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/HPV-vaccine-administered-doses.jpg" style="background-image: none; color: #18188b;"><img alt="HPV-vaccine-administered-doses" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20121" height="420" src="http://sanevax.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/HPV-vaccine-administered-doses.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgb(221, 221, 221); display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; max-width: 98%; padding: 4px;" width="560" /></a></div>Joint meetings of the Vaccine Adverse Reactions Review Committee (JVARRC) are held three times a year. 1968 cases of adverse events have been reported to JMLHW and JVARRC. 358 cases which were evaluated as serious by the committee and JMLHW are included.<br /><br />The presence of girls suffering from adverse effects of cervical cancer vaccine was revealed gradually from the beginning of 2013. The Nationwide Liaison Association of Cervical Cancer Vaccine Victims and Parents was organized by efforts of Toshie Ikeda, Mika Matsufuji and members of municipal assembly on Mar 25, 2013.<br /><br />Parents of vaccine victims called our health minister on April 8. During the press conference after that, videos in which girls are suffering from walking disturbances, tic of the body, absence seizure and choreic movement was presented.<br /><br />June 14 2013, JVRRC decided to suspend the recommendation for HPV vaccination. The same day, JMLHW sent a notification to local governments that HPV vaccination should not be recommended actively until the time when MHLW and JVRRC made a report as to the safety concerns of HPV vaccines and that vaccination should be done for those who want vaccination. In the meantime, HPV vaccination should be available for those who wished it.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/stepoutsidethebox.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kADbI3spO2M/TwILKt_It9I/AAAAAAAANvU/F0N-dw_gGR4/s261/cancer.png" /></a>The Congress of Professionals for Suppressing Uterine Cervical Cancer and Japan Pediatrics Association made a statement that JMHLW should “withdraw the suspension of recommendation” for HPV vaccination and should “restore the recommendation” for the vaccination.<br /><br /><b>Does vaso-vagal reflex cause consciousness derangement and falls?</b><br /><br />In the early period of HPV vaccination program, many girls who were injected with the vaccine fell down to the floor within several minutes injuring their heads or faces. Some girls fractured their jaws and teeth.  JMHLW and the JVRRAC announced that the reaction was due to vaso-vagal reflex and vaccinated girls should be kept in medical facilities and lying down for­ at least 30 minutes.<br /><br />Vaccine manufacturers have an obligation of post-licensure vigilance. A document titled “On the issue of adverse reaction in relation to syncope after vaccination” had been published on every committee meeting where additional cases were presented.  The document consists of two parts: each one is made and submitted by GSK K.K. and MSD K.K. The one dated Mar 25 2012, consisting of 77 pages, is estimated as the best.

MSD analyzed 91 cases.<br /><br />Severe pain is thought to bring vaso-vagal reflex. Vaso-vagal reflex brings hypotension and bradycardia (low blood pressure less than 80 mmHg and low heart rate less than 30~40/min. Numerical values are author’s estimations). Low blood pressure results in an insufficient blood supply to the brain and normal brain function cannot be maintained.<br /><br />But, with my experience, visual stimuli such like seeing wounds or blood may bring nausea and hypotension. Pain does not always cause vaso-vagal reflex.<br /><br />Table 2 made by GSK K.K. (page4) and that made by MSD K.K. (page 59) shows the states or conditions of the recipients while unconscious.<br /><br />Items and legends of the tables are translated word for word.<br /><br />Cervarix: page 4<br /><br />Table 2: Situations or states of the cases who lost consciousness (cases in whom symptom occurred within 30 min)<br /><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="color: #222222;

Postures before collapsing were sitting in 8 cases, standing in 4 cases, unknown in 1 case. In 7 cases who had injured in the chin and face,  loosing/fracture/dislocation of teeth  (3 cases), fracture of mental bone (1 case), bruise in mental bone and lip (6 cases), nasal bleeding (1 case).<br /><br />In the case of Cervarix, the first row in the above table shows that low blood pressure was observed only in 39 cases (20%). The second row of the table is written as “Clonic motion (seizure is included) 18.9%”. Clonic motion is an involuntary motion in which arms and/or legs are jerked and extended rhythmically, i.e. seizure.<br /><br />The first and the second row of table 4 shows that girls did not necessarily fall down with hypotension. Injection of Cervarix itself seems to induce convulsions in the vaccinated girls. It is the same in the case of Gardasil.<br /><br />GSK had made a file titled as “List of cases with secondary injury to syncope brought by injection of Cervarix” in which 41 case records are contained (page 7 to 35).<br /><br />Seizure or convulsion occurred in 12 cases (case 1, 3, 8, 9, 10, 17, 18, 19, 24, 26, 37 and 39).<br /><br />In case 26 (see Addendum), tonic-clonic seizure and apnea occurred just after the injection, although blood pressure was not low. Case 15 was also with apnea.<br /><br />These tables and case records in this document may show that girls fell to the floor with an attack of unconsciousness brought by hypotension (pre-shock). But these also show that girls had been attacked with seizures, which caused unconsciousness and loss of controls of skeletal muscles of the body. As a result, they fell to the floor like a pole. As girls could not prepare a defensive posture on falling, they injured by hitting their heads and jaws.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; <br /><b>Consciousness derangement occurred more than 30 minutes after injection in vaccinated girls.</b><br /><br />Cervarix: page 5<br /><br /><div align="left" style="color: #444444;

In 23 vaccinated girls, it occurred from 24 hours to 7 days. The sum of the raw is 95. In these girls, it occurred more than 30 min outside medical institutions. In these girls, syncope or unconsciousness occurred outside medical institutions.<br /><br />If recipients fell into vaso-vagal reflex and pre-shock, they might recover within 30 minutes at the most. Therefore, the cause of consciousness derangement or convulsion was not brought with hypotension due to vaso-vagal reflex.<br /><br />GSK made a list of cases with late syncope attack which occurred more than 30 min after injection of Cervarix, and which title is “Cases in whom syncope occurred more than 30 min after injection of Cervarix” (page 36 to 52).<br /><br />In some cases, diarrhea, menstrual cramps, taking bath or generalized urticarial seemed to bring syncope (case 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 23 and 28). But syncope is unusual in healthy teenager girls.<br /><br />Convulsion or seizure occurred in 8 cases (case 2, 3, 8, 13, 16, 18, 24 and 30).<br /><br />It should be considered that some brain damage occurred in these cases.<br /><br />(In case 19, on 6th day after injection, cardiac and pulmonary arrest occurred after 100m running of a button relay in training for a sports festival of the junior high school. CPR was successful by ambulance team at school and by doctors in a hospital. But severe brain damage occurred.

What's worse, a number of studies demonstrated that mammography increases total mortality.<br /><br />A principal reason for this finding of harm is that screening for early forms of breast cancer leads to overdiagnosis. That is, the detection of pseudo-cancers or non-cancers -"cancers" that would not cause harm, such as the demise of a patient during her lifetime, if not detected and treated. All of these "cancers" tend to get treated aggressively with conventional cancer therapies, causing significant collateral damage, including death, to basically healthy women as breast cancer screening is marketed primarily towards healthy women.<br /><br /><b>Why Do All Breast Cancer Screening Tests Cause Serious, Unnecessary Harm?</b><br /><br />An "alternative" to a conventional approach, akin to a "natural" product versus a non-natural product, isn't necessarily safe or without serious risks, as such "non-mainstream" services and products are often portrayed.<br /><br />Much of the public has been led to believe that alternatives to mammograms are non-harmful because they don't incur radiation toxicity. But the radiation problem is an "intrinsic" issue of mammography while all imaging modalities are still rooted in, and an outcome of, the largely unscientific medical theories about breast cancer.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/millions-wrongly-treated-cancer-national-cancer-institute-panel-confirms">Overdiagnosis from diagnostic screening</a> modalities is predominantly the result of a LACK of sound science (instead we have medical dogmas) about breast cancer, not something specifically and exclusively related to mammography, rendering mammogram alternatives also problematic.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>If you're basic premises on breast cancer are strongly erroneous, unclear, and ambiguous, diagnosis and treatments will naturally be too.<br /><br />Research studies have found that overdiagnosis with cancer screening is highly prevalent and significant, encompassing numerous categories of cancer (e.g., prostate, lung, and thyroid cancer) and several imaging modalities such as mammography, MRIs, and ultrasound [1-4]. And as explained above, overdiagnosis means needless overtreatment (=unnecessary harm).<br /><br />Also, overdiagnosis is a pertinent reality with any type of screening method of early detection of breast cancer.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />● Because all diagnostic screening tests of early detection of breast cancer are in use and promoted based on the medical ASSUMPTION that a breast "cancer" is going to progress linearly and universally into an advanced, progressive type, hence it needs to be detected early and eradicated per that theory. Plenty of sound scientific evidence refutes this notion of breast cancer progression. It was demonstrated, for example, that even a severely mutated cancer tissue doesn't necessarily or predictably evolve into a progressive, fatal cancer (references in my ebook "The Mammogram Myth").<br /><br />Wrong notions seldom produce good or reliable results (at least for most people).<br /><br />The ramification of this is that orthodox medicine is treating a lot of breast "cancers," no matter the screening method they are found by, that either would never progress (or only insignificantly) to harm the patient in her lifetime or that (entirely) regress (references in my ebook "The Mammogram Myth").<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N2GOFRKd8Vs/UF4PWWZ5dsI/AAAAAAAARz4/tuwcrewmlWA/s316/herbalcures.png" style="background-image: none; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: none;" width="160" /></a>A disease, like health, is a fluid, non-static "state". It is affected by a myriad of factors, constantly steering the human organism into either a constructive or degenerative direction of being. This multi-factorial, ever-changing situation proffers plenty of opportunity for positive modification, at any age, in terms of an individual's "state" of health.<br /><br />However, this window of change ("plasticity") is greatest when a disease such as breast cancer is in the early stages, narrowing steadily and progressively roughly in proportion to the continuation of degeneration of the tissue abnormality. Therefore, it seems most reasonable to put strong emphasis on assisting the body in constructively re-directing the course of (particularly) EARLY-STAGE breast "cancer" instead of eradicating it with toxic traditional cancer therapies, especially since all invasive cancer treatments increase the risk of secondary cancer (frequently metastatic) and mortality. But generally, what follows a diagnosis of breast cancer is a destructive, rather than a constructive, approach of "cure". While thermography is advertised as non-invasive, totally painless, and "respectful" by its proponents, numerous early breast "cancers" discovered by it end up getting treated with invasive, "disrespectful" orthodox cancer treatments, making thermography only appear "respectful" on the surface.<br /><br />Here is where a big danger of unnecessary harm lays with some mammogram alternatives (certainly if a breast cancer diagnosis is followed up with orthodox cancer therapies). MRIs and thermography, for instance, are touted as finding breast cancer at even earlier stages than mammograms, when at or near the abnormal tissue growth's peak of regenerative capability and possibility (that can result in, for example, the spontaneous regression of the tissue abnormality). Why seriously harming the body at a time when it has the biggest probability of successful recovery in the absence of clear scientific evidence that screening for early breast cancers leads to a decrease in breast cancer mortality?<br /><br />● Because, at present, medical science cannot reliably predict, based on cell histopathology, whether a breast "cancer" is going to be a progressive (=likely fatal) or non-progressive (=basically harmless) cancer (references in my ebook "The Mammogram Myth").<br /><br />Ambiguous notions seldom produce good or reliable results (at least for most people).<br /><br />As long as the medical profession doesn't truly know what it is actually treating (a real or pseudo cancer), any screening method (with its aim and function of "digging up" tissue abnormalities, that is breast cancers), whether orthodox or alternative, is inescapably going to inflict large and significant damage, in particular over the long run and because of the large scale of screening implementation. Nevertheless, it is not uncommon for avid proponents of mammogram alternatives to miss or disregard this scientific reality.<br /><br />Therefore, if you detect a lot of early breast cancers, particularly with screening tests that are credited with being better in discovering them, such as thermography and MRIs, you are increasing the pool of cancers that potentially and actually are going to get treated unnecessarily. As a consequence, overdiagnosis is conceivably even larger with certain mammogram alternatives, but at a minimum it is likely significant (as with mammography). For example, overdiagnosis from MRI usage for breast cancer detection is extensive, causing massive damage [3].<br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/eatingforenergy.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NXBnYCOlwMY/UVM5JONZ6bI/AAAAAAAAUmY/Vf3sgEPfneI/s200/200-3.jpg" /></a><br />Thermography, an alternative non-invasive imaging test using infrared technology to detect inflammatory heat patterns and distribution of body surface temperatures of breast tissue, also cannot reliably determine and predict if a (potential) breast cancer is going to progress or not based on markers of thermal abnormalities even though the method is based on rather valid physiological events.<br /><br />For instance, thermal abnormalities, as spotted by thermography, are not present in all breast cancers because there's a wide variety of cancer tumors emitting different amounts of heat due to differences in the formation of (new) blood vessels (angiogensis) and metabolic energy output [5,6]. In a group of confirmed breast cancer patients no difference in 5-year survival was recorded between those who had a thermograpic abnormality and those who did not [7]. The differentiation between a malignant breast cancer and a benign tissue growth, such as fibrocystic mastopathy, is seriously challenging or impossible with the use of thermography [8], although newer infrared imaging technology has made significant strides in this regard [9]. At least one study [6] reported no link between a temperature abnormality and the proliferation rate of the examined breast cancers.<br /><br />Thermography only measures SURFACE skin temperatures. If a breast cancer develops near the chest wall, for instance, its thermophysical signature (conceivably) wont register on the surface. Another obstacle diminishing the predictive dependability of this imaging tool centers around the difficulty in accurately interpreting a thermogram [10], in part, because of a lack of a standard protocol guiding clinical interpretation of images [11].<br /><br />Also, since the "early detection" of breast cancer with mammography hasn't (notably) reduced breast cancer mortality, what valid, reliable evidence is there suggesting a mammogram alternative, geared also at early detection, would be significantly beneficial? For example, no randomized studies have been conducted on MRIs, ultrasound, and thermography [12].<br /><br />Some investigative data on thermography revealed that the test did poorly in discovering primary breast cancers [13,14]. Some researchers maintained that there is insufficient adequate and solid scientific data substantiating the value of thermography [15,16].<br /><br />A few cancer screening scientists had cautioned that "Given the potential for serious harms in healthy individuals, screening should be offered only when the benefits are firmly documented and considered to outweigh the harms [...]." [17 (emphasis added)].<br /><br />When faced with a lack of credible data on the clear benefits of a screening method, considerable scientific certainty the test doesn't inflict much serious harm becomes imperative. This, however, is very problematic to ascertain when the worst types of harms from breast cancer screening, including from mammography and alternatives such as MRIs and ultrasound, routinely remain undisclosed in the medical literature [17].<br /><br /><b>There Is "First, We Do No Harm" And Then There Is Reality</b><br /><br />The rationale of traditional medicine, fueled heavily by a dogmatic commitment to their unscientific theoretical notions about breast cancer, is to generally treat, as a precaution, all forms of breast "cancer" as some tissue abnormalities will evolve into progressive malignant breast cancers. Yet, this general practice totally violates what the medical establishment officially promises and wants the public to believe about the industry: 'first, we do no harm'.<br /><br />The sad reality of overdiagnosis is that many basically HEALTHY women end up routinely getting invasive cancer treatments, causing -unnecessarily- enormous harm, including the causation of real cancer and premature death. The fundamental predicament is sort of like sending a lot of INNOCENT women to prison for many years, in some instances, for the rest of their lives. What woman would cheerfully volunteer for such a precarious scenario (=screening for early breast cancer) if she knew the basic reality underlying the medical test?<br /><br />Don't forget, this is no small matter. It is a scientific certainty that millions of healthy women have been seriously harmed and killed by overdiagnosis because of the widespread implementation of these various diagnostic screening methods on a global scale over the last few decades.<br />The Most Serious Harms Of Breast Cancer Screening Are Hidden From The Public<br /><br />Disturbingly, a review of randomized trials on cancer screening revealed that the arguably greatest source of harm from screening (whether it is from mammography or safer options such as MRIs and ultrasound), overdiagnosis, was seldom reported or quantified [17].<br /><br />In "The Mammogram Myth" I showed just how commonly mammogram risks are under reported and downplayed in the medical literature.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/reiki.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Py9fWGMLj9o/UKbVkpI60yI/AAAAAAAASjA/bHKWFAXMkHs/s240/ad7.jpg" /></a>Essentially, the biggest known dangers of breast cancer screening are "swept under the rug" by the same conglomerate of people (the medical orthodoxy) who claims and swears to wanting to help women with breast cancer. If you take your car to a mechanic who promises to be of service to you, works on your car but then knowingly fails to point out to you that there's a good chance the wheels on your car will come off because the screws are loose, do you conclude, knowing all of this, the mechanic's claim to help you is credible and trustworthy?<br /><br />Confronted by a research environment where severe screening dangers are systematically "whitewashed", some investigators concluded that, "Healthcare decision makers, healthcare practitioners, and, ultimately, patients therefore cannot make informed choices about cancer screening." [17]<br /><br />The commercialized medical industry, in general, has been carefully hiding the true dangers of its cornucopia of medical interventions and services. A lack of research papers demonstrating, or alleged top-notch studies lacking the reporting of, risks from breast cancer screening, whether with mammography or mammogram alternatives, doesn't mean the threats don't exist in real life, especially when a plethora of valid investigations found they do.<br /><br />The public gets exposed to a lot of fancy medical claims about the various breast screening modalities, "first, we do not harm", "early detection of breast cancer significantly decreases mortality from the disease", "radiation risks from mammography are negligible or hypothetical", "overdiagnosis is insignificant", all of which is either not backed up by any meaningful scientific evidence or soundly disproven by actual facts and reality.<br /><br />In "The Mammogram Myth" I had suggested that what the public really ought to worry about is what the traditional medical industry is NOT telling them about a medical procedure.<br />Breast Cancer Screening Isn't Really About Prevention<br /><br />More important than having knowledge of "detached" pearls of scientific data or information about a topic is the proper understanding of that data's meaning and significance within a larger context.<br /><br />A serious problem, such as breast cancer, can only really be solved if causes are addressed. The prevention of anything is the avoidance of a problem BEFORE it "raises its ugly head" by taking care of its causes. Breast cancer screening aimed at "early detection", with both traditional and non-traditional procedures, is about diagnosis (and subsequent treatment) of a problem that has NOT been prevented. It is discovery of a problem (i.e., breast cancer) once it already has manifested itself in the human body. The manifestation of breast cancer is testimony that causes of the disease have not been taken care of.<br /><br />This is further corroborated by many good research papers reporting no decrease in the incidence of progressive, invasive breast cancers following the implementation of mammography. It is indication that the widely promoted claim about mammography as a "preventive" medical procedure is inappropriate and misleading, at the very least.<br /><br />True prevention of breast cancer entails the avoidance of the principal causes of the disease, and making your body generally more healthy (primarily through optimized nutrition via diet and nutritional supplements) to forgo the manifestation of this dreaded illness.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's where the crux of the multifaceted problem of breast cancer prevention is buried:<br /><br />● The true causes of breast cancer remain largely unknown to women at large because of politics in orthodox medicine, enormous profits that are at stake for the medical industry, and the cultural dominance of corporate self-interests (references in my ebook "The Mammogram Myth"). A lack of awareness about the real causes of breast cancer undermines women's intention and aim of effectively preventing the disease;<br /><br />● Many people don't recognize their utmost responsibility for their own health, failing to incorporate true preventative measures into their lifestyle. The sociologist Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) encapsulated this with his insightful statement, "The preservation of health is a duty. Few seem conscious that there is such a thing as physical morality.";<br /><br />●The rather common lack of a sense of obligation for one's own health is enabled or facilitated by the commercialized culture of many industrialized nations that encourages us to shift the responsibility for our own health (in the form of true prevention) from ourselves to the medical establishment (whose fundamental, primary practice is diagnosis and treatment, not prevention).<br /><br />The corporate culture's self-interests and influence help to assure that the public's focus is predominantly centered around "preventive" breast screening tests, rather than on true prevention. You're supposed to believe that diagnosis and treatment, not prevention, is "the solution" to beating breast cancer, despite the fact that not one chronic degenerative disease, like cancer, has ever been cured by this approach.<br /><br />In the US, for instance, over 99% of all healthcare dollars go to the diagnosis and treatment of disease [18]. Nations dominated by corporatism, such as the US, don't fundamentally care about prevention in healthcare, as the fiscal record of budget allocation proves. How come? The chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, Otis Webb Brawley, MD, explained it in plain language in 2012: "there is no money in prevention" [19]. Naturally, this epitomizes a situation highly profitable to the medical industry but extremely costly to a society in terms of both fiscal resources and human suffering and lives lost;<br /><br />● The magnitude of poor health (i.e., the incidence of health issues) rises in direct proportion to the income inequality within a nation's populace [20]. Economic inequality (this gap is very distinct and large in the US at present) makes it tougher or impossible for many people to properly take care of their own health due to heightened financial quandaries and increased psychological stress.<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying that certain breast screening tests don't have (some) value, it's just that in a commercialized culture almost all "scientific" information is "generated" to show and promote the benefits of "diagnosis and treatments" in the form of profit-producing medical products and services, while greatly minimizing and obfuscating their true risks, obstructing a person's sincere desire and opportunity to make an informed decision.<br /><br />For more information (including copious scientific references) on overdiagnosis, mammogram alternatives, traditional medical theories of breast cancer, and various (disregarded) facts about breast cancer see my (e)book The Mammogram Myth: The Independent Investigation Of Mammography The Medical Profession Doesn't Want You To Know About.<br /><br />At <a href="http://www.themammogrammyth.com/">http://www.TheMammogramMyth.com</a>, I discuss some summary points of "The Mammogram Myth".<br /><br />An (e)book Kindle version of "The Mammogram Myth" is available for purchase, for only $7.99, from Amazon at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EJWYG7S">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EJWYG7S</a> (non-affiliate link).

There are plenty of reasons; namely, your health. But you might hear people regurgitate the same old biotech slogans, when really it's about feeding a bottomless bottom line and propelling an even bigger agenda.<br /><br />Biotech and chemical companies like Monsanto, DuPont, and Dow to name a few, love the technique of repetition to sell lies. They have all they need in the way of lobbying, media, buying science, and government approval to continue doing just that. If Nestle food giant hires cyber armies to put out social media fires, what do you think the other largest corporations in the world do? Monsanto goes to <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/monsanto-declares-social-media-war-against-protesters-05212013" target="_blank">social media war</a>, too, and even has contracts with Blackwater to deal with activists. They start websites to aid public relations.<br /><br />Last month, with the help of a video guide, there were five of the more <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/08/top-5-gmo-myths-debunked.html" target="_blank">popular GMO lines debunked</a>.

A 2009 report by the Union of Concerned Scientists showed how genetic engineering absolutely has not increased yields.<br />It's been proven that GMOs give their <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/08/thanks-for-super-genes-weeds-receive.html" target="_blank">transgenic material</a> to the weeds they are designed to combat - which means more superweeds and subsequently, less crop yield.<br /><br />Big Agri pays little attention to soil health and encourages pestilence with monoculture. But there is a resurgence of interest in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/03/study-biodiversity-from-polyculture.html">biodiversity from polyculture</a>&nbsp;with great success.&nbsp;Organic farming in Africa increased yields by 116 percent.&nbsp;There are people around the world who grow giant vegetables naturally. Russia feeds its people with community <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=8&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CFQQFjAH&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnaturalhomes.org%2Fnaturalliving%2Frussian-dacha.htm&amp;ei=fetFUtrtEOjq2gXL44HgBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1FZku6RSO5sI3SlEMR8I78cCR7w&amp;bvm=bv.53217764,d.b2I" target="_blank">dacha gardens</a>. <a href="http://www.growingpower.org/index.htm" target="_blank">Will Allen</a>&nbsp;is a renown urban farmer who creates tons of food in winter without heat. Innovation abounds.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/07/failure-of-monsanto-seed-leads-to-new.html" target="_blank">Rotation</a> is a solution even for large-scale farms seeking help from GMO-induced pestilence. Food goes <a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/2013/04/tips-for-understanding-and-avoiding.html" target="_blank">to waste</a> in our country and there are regulations that keep perfectly good food from hungry people. In other places there may be food, but no money to buy.<br /><br />A Gates/Rockefeller-fueled project of&nbsp;the International Rice Research Institute ended when around 400 protesters in the Philippines <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/08/philippines-protesters-trample-uproot.html" target="_blank">trampled it</a> - they didn't want "the help." IRRI is going to force it on them anyway. To say that there is only one solution to feed the world and it involves marring the entire ecology is absurd and false, as it does not work. If that solution is so great, then why the need to force it?<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/organics.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5nLmWzKFs60/URRNIOJzCiI/AAAAAAAAUEc/HqENLf1jZeM/s250/BANNER150.jpg" /></a><b>Myth #4: GMOs reduce pesticide use</b><br /><br />Why would the biggest producers of chemical pesticides create a product that would kill their biggest product lines? If GMOs really reduced pesticide use, their profits would be going down, not up. And farmers wouldn't be forced to double down on pesticide use in the presence of superweeds and superpests.<br /><br />The rise of glyphosate-resistant superweeds has increased pesticide use by 183 million kilograms in the last 15 years according to a <a href="http://www.enveurope.com/content/24/1/24" target="_blank">2012 report</a>.<br /><br /><b>Myth #3: No evidence of health problems</b><br /><br />And how would they know? How would the FDA know? The FDA doesn't test, but literally takes the word of the corporation. Finding out GMOs pass their transgenic material into the surrounding environment took years because biotech companies do not allow academic testing of their patented, heavily guarded products.<br /><br />We are expected to be human guinea pigs over one of the biggest food and ecological impacts - that never had any real testing. One would think at least a year of testing would be in order, but the full health impacts of GMOs remain to be seen. However, what little independent testing that has been done shows a <i>pattern</i> of cancer, obesity, liver failure, digestive disease, infertility, and immune dysfunction and that pattern does correlate with global disease spikes in those diseases for the last 15 years, although GMOs are not the only factor.<br /><br /><b>Myth #2: No difference between genetic engineering and traditional breeding techniques</b><br /><br />In other words, genetic engineering and conventional breeding (for thousands of years) are the same exact thing. Many journalists pump out this oft-repeated lie. Or they might say, same thing just faster. When you realize what natural breeding techniques like selective and cross breeding look like compared to the intensive lab genetically engineered plants - it's completely ridiculous to try to put them in the same universe.<br /><br />Traditional breeding involves taking one strain of a crop and breeding it with another strain of that same species. Genetic engineering takes genetic material from an entirely different species, not even plant-based, such as bacteria, and inserts it into a plant such as corn - sometimes firing the gene into the cell willy-nilly. A Japanese researcher recently <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/08/newly-developed-rice-increases-yield-in.html" target="_blank">conventionally bred</a> rice to make a generation that would yield way more during drought, without genetic modification. Making the argument that conventional breeding throughout the ages is the same thing as altering the genetic makeup to create a new plant is like saying that "breeding of humans of different ethnic backgrounds is the same as breeding between humans and horses."[1]<br /><br /><b>Myth #1: GMOs shouldn't be labeled...for some reason</b><br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/organicfood.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TVMjhwwmubI/AAAAAAAAGog/o5L9_eBqktU/food4wealthbook2.png" /></a>There are a couple angles to this one. Big food companies and grocers tried to claim it would raise the average person's yearly grocery bills by $400. That is ridiculous, as food companies clamor to get your good faith back with label changes. "No high fructose corn syrup!" and "Gluten-free!" even on bottled water are prime examples. We're talking about three words "genetically modified ingredients." Some companies wish to disassociate by joining GMO-Free projects and wearing it like a badge on their products.<br /><br />But the main reason stated for not labeling is insulting and nonsensical: That it would unnecessarily scare the consumer. <i>Because more information is frightful</i>&nbsp;and we shouldn't know about what we put in our mouths. But that has not happened in European countries who adopted GM labeling. Informed consumption goes on....<br /><br />GM food will never be labeled in America, but raising awareness and making the demand and sticking with it is a great thing. <a href="http://www.kidsrighttoknow.com/2013/08/rachel-parent-on-the-lang-oleary-exchange-cbc-tv-show/" target="_blank">Rachel Parent</a>, the 14-year-old activist stuck with that point even though shyster show host, Kevin O'Leary, who was debating her constantly tried to get her off the point - even calling her a shill. If the majority of people are screaming for a simple label that will not be provided, there is obviously a much bigger reason.

It can control everything from our sleep/wake cycles to our reproduction, weight, mood and even strong anti-aging and anti-tumor effects. Melatonin is found in many foods such as mustard, goji berries, almonds, sunflower seeds, cardamom, fennel, coriander and cherries. However, it also easily absorbed through quality supplementation in therapeutic doses.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Melatonin is found in animals, plants, and microbes. It is a natural hormone segregated by the body and melatonin levels generally increase in the dark at night. In part, your body clock controls how much melatonin your body makes. Normally, melatonin levels begin to rise in the mid- to late evening, remain high for most of the night, and then drop in the early morning hours.<br /><br />Light affects how much melatonin your body produces. During the shorter days of the winter months, your body may produce melatonin either earlier or later in the day than usual. This change can lead to symptoms of<a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/articles/winter_depression_melatonin.shtml">seasonal affective disorder</a> (SAD), or winter depression.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br />"In patients who had SAD, the duration of melatonin secretion became longer in winter and shorter in summer, just as it occurs in other mammals,'' lead author Dr. Thomas A. Wehr, a research psychiatrist at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, stated. "That could be controlling this panoply of changes that occurs in people when they get depressed in the winter.''<br /><br />Natural melatonin levels slowly drop with age. Some older adults make very small amounts of it or none at all.<br /><br /><b>Low Levels of Melatonin Associated With Increased Cancer Risk</b><br /><br />Recent research has suggested that low melatonin levels in the body may be linked to a higher risk of certain types of cancer. For example, a few studies have found that women who work night shifts for many years (and therefore would be expected to have lower levels of melatonin) seem to have a slightly higher risk of breast and colorectal cancer.<br /><br />Melatonin has been shown to slow or stop the growth of several types of cancer cells and even treat cancer. Some of the studies have suggested that melatonin may extend survival and improve quality of life for patients with certain types of untreatable cancers such as advanced lung cancer and melanoma. Some studies reported that a small number of cancers went into total or partial remission<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/miracle-mind.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HGjRvm6ztkU/T2NuWoVyJiI/AAAAAAAAOq4/TVW-15MhTLc/s200/200x200.jpg" /></a>Peer-reviewed and published research has shown melatonin offers particularly strong protection against reproductive cancers. Cells throughout your body -- even cancer cells -- have melatonin receptors. So when melatonin makes its nightly rounds, cell division slows. When this hormone latches onto a breast cancer cell, it has been found to counteract estrogen's tendency to stimulate cell growth.<br /><br />In fact, melatonin has a calming effect on several reproductive hormones, which may explain why it seems to protect against sex hormone-driven cancers, including ovarian, endometrial, breast, prostate and testicular cancers. <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/greenmed/topic/37477/focus/1080/page">GreenMedInfo</a> lists twenty studies demonstrating exactly how melatonin exerts its protective effects against breast cancer.<br /><br />But melatonin's anti-cancer effects don't stop there. While causing cancer cells to self-destruct, melatonin also boosts your production of immune stimulating substances such as interleukin-2, which helps identify and attack the mutated cells that lead to cancer. The greatest area of melatonin research to date has to do with <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/10/15/mammograms-much-less-useful-than-previously-believed.aspx">breast cancer</a>. Some of the more impressive studies include the following:<br /><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11138824?dopt=Abstract">The journal Epidemiology</a> reported increased breast cancer risk among women who work predominantly night shifts<br /><br />Women who live in neighborhoods with large amounts of nighttime illumination are more likely to get breast cancer than those who live in areas where nocturnal darkness prevails, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20680434">according to an Israeli study</a><br /><br />From participants in the <a href="http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/93/20/1563.long">Nurses' Health Study</a>, it was found that nurses who work nights had 36 percent higher rates of breast cancer.<br /><br />Blind women, whose eyes cannot detect light and so have robust production of melatonin, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9730026?dopt=Abstract">have lower-than-average breast cancer rates</a><br /><br />When the body of epidemiological studies are considered in their totality, women who work night shift are found to have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/19/AR2008021902398.html">breast cancer rates 60 percent above normal</a>, even when other factors such as differences in diet are accounted for. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2bLJYdgCGK0/UkXo3Jtp9aI/AAAAAAAAAnM/59ZwoCAZbdo/s1600/melatonin-benefits12s.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2bLJYdgCGK0/UkXo3Jtp9aI/AAAAAAAAAnM/59ZwoCAZbdo/s400/melatonin-benefits12s.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>Stimulates Beige Fat</b><br /><br />Spanish scientists have discovered that melatonin consumption helps control weight gain because it stimulates the appearance of 'beige fat', a type of fat cell that burns calories in vivo instead of storing them. White adipose tissue stores calories leading to weight gain whereas 'beige fat' (also known as 'good or thinning fat') helps regulate body weight control, hence its metabolic benefits.<br /><br />In the <i><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpi.12089/abstract">Journal of Pineal Research</a>,</i> scientists from the University of Granada Institute for Neuroscience, the Hospital Carlos III, Madrid, and the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio (USA) have revealed, for the first time, the previously unknown enigma of why melatonin has metabolic benefits in treating diabetes and hyperlipidemia.<br /><br />In earlier publications, the researchers analysed the effects of melatonin on obesity, dyslipidemia, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes mellitus associated with obesity in young obese diabetic Zucker rats--an experimental model of metabolic syndrome.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/eatingforenergy.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-khc-CD__YDo/UVM3nxnfDEI/AAAAAAAAUmE/RRSuc0x5jzk/s125/125X125.jpg" /></a>In view of their most recent results, it seems the key lies in the fact that chronic melatonin consumption not only induces the appearance of 'beige fat' in obese diabetic rats, but also increases its presence in thin animals used as a control group. 'Beige fat' cells are found in scattered lentil-sized deposits beneath the inguinal skin in obese diabetic Zucker rats.<br /><br />These findings, together with the pharmacologically safe profile of melatonin, mean it is a potentially useful tool both in its own right and to complement the treatment of obesity. Sleeping in the dark and consuming these foodstuffs could help control weight gain and prevent cardiovascular diseases associated with obesity and dyslipidemia.<br /><br />The study--coordinated by University of Granada lecturer Ahmad Agil--showed that chronic administration of melatonin sensitizes the thermogenic effect of exposure to cold, heightens the thermogenic effect of exercise and, therefore, constitutes excellent therapy against obesity. The fact is that one of the key differences between 'beige fat', which appears when administering melatonin, and 'white fat', is that 'beige fat' cell mitochondria express levels of UCP1 protein, responsible for burning calories and generating heat.<br /><br />Melatonin has been found to promote health in many other ways:<br /><ul><li>Melatonin can protect against heart disease. It's been shown to increase "good" (HDL) cholesterol and play a role in lowering blood pressure. Melatonin can also protect your heart during a heart attack.</li><li>There is increasing evidence that melatonin secretion is related tomigraine and headache disorders, Dr. Mario F. P. Peres, of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, in Sao Paulo, and colleagues note in the<a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/articles/melatonin_may_prevent_migraines.shtml">medical journal Neurology</a>. After 3 months of melatonin supplementation, subjects experience a 50 percent reduction in headache frequency.</li><li>Melatonin is highly beneficial in those with diabetes. It protects the pancreatic cells, slowing down the progression of this disease. It also has very strong anti-oxidant properties reducing the damage to kidneys, eyes and circulation that is common in those with diabetes.</li><li>Melatonin protects against Alzheimer's disease and slows down progression in the early stages of the disease. This is due to its strong anti-oxidant properties along with its ability to readily cross the blood-brain barrier.</li><li>Melatonin may help prevent osteoporosis. While further research is needed, early studies suggest that melatonin may prevent bone loss and increase new bone formation.</li></ul><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/stepoutsidethebox.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kADbI3spO2M/TwILKt_It9I/AAAAAAAANvU/F0N-dw_gGR4/s261/cancer.png" /></a> Those who struggle to lose weight may benefit from melatonin. Lack of sleep causes an increase in appetite through disruption of your appetite hormones resulting in the consumption of more food in those who are sleep-deprived. <br /><br /><b>Why Quality Supplementation is Important</b><br /><br />Some reports show that around age 6, melatonin secretions from the pineal gland begin to decrease due to the increased intake of food as we grow (melatonin is thought to be found in all foods). But the melatonin in foods may not be enough to replace the needs in the body, so it is highly recommended to use dietary supplementation as a means of receiving additional melatonin.<br /><br />There is relatively good evidence that melatonin supplements can influence sleep and fatigue and can help with jet lag and some sleep problems.Melatonin is a well tolerated, non-habit-forming agent which does not produce grogginess. Some research shows that melatonin affects not only how quickly people fall asleep but also the duration and quality of sleep. <br /><br />More evidence is coming forward showing that melatonin, when taken as a supplement, can stop or slow the spread of cancer, make the immune system stronger, or slow down the aging process. In most cases, melatonin supplementation is safe in both low doses for short-term and long-term use.<br /><br /><b>How much and what kind of melatonin should you take?</b><br /><br /><a href="http://preventdisease.com/hpp/zen-cart/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=201">Life Choice uses the purest source of melatonin</a> in the world. They only use 100% DMF (drug master file) patented pharmaceutical grade raw material; paying 700% more for their raw material than can be purchased without a patent. Why? The reasons are two-fold: first, the material is clinically researched, and secondly, the quality is consistently high with each order.

This latter, strictly theoretical benefit is increasingly being disproved by the biomedical literature. In fact, last year, we reported in an article titled, "<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/blind-truth-eye-damaging-effects-statins">Blind To The Truth: The Eye-Damaging Effects of Statins</a>," on findings published in Optometry and Vision Science, revealing that statin drugs users have a 48% higher risk of pathological eye lens changes commonly associated with cataract formation.<br /><div><br /></div><div>A cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye which leads to a decrease in vision, and is a leading cause of blindness in the world. The most commonly identified causes are aging, trauma and excessive UV radiation exposure, along with a still poorly understood genetic component. While there is preclinical evidence that the opacity of the lens can be <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/wheat-grass-may-reverse-cataract-associated-lens-opacity">reversed through natural substances such as wheatgrass</a>,<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/cholesterol-drugs-linked-eye-damage-jama-study-confirms-anew-0#_ftn2">[2]</a> the most common conventional approach is to treat the condition with surgery, which does nothing to mitigate or undo the underlying causes.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br />Researchers at San Antonio Military Medical Center, San Antonio Texas, compared the risks for development of cataracts between statin users and nonusers, using a military health care system database. The study design was described as follows:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Based on medication fills during fiscal year 2005, patients were divided into 2 groups: (1) statin users (received at least a 90-day supply of statin) and (2) nonusers (never received a statin throughout the study). Among 46 249 patients meeting study criteria, we identified 13 626 statin users and 32 623 nonusers.</blockquote><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/noglasses.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IQ7oIXHgMzo/UHMzSSxm7JI/AAAAAAAAAMc/QLBCBq0F0O0/s300/ad1%25285%2529.jpg" /></a>The main results were reported as follows:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">For our primary analysis, we matched 6972 pairs of statin users and nonusers. The risk for cataract was higher among statin users in comparison with nonusers in the propensity score-matched cohort (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.17). In secondary analyses, after adjusting for identified confounders, the incidence of cataract was higher in statin users in comparison with nonusers (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.15-1.40). Sensitivity analysis confirmed this relationship.</blockquote>In other words, the risk for cataract was between 9% and 27% higher in statin users, leading the study authors to conclude: "The risk for cataract is increased among statin users as compared with nonusers. The risk-benefit ratio of statin use, specifically for primary prevention, should be carefully weighed, and further studies are warranted."<br /><br />What is important to point out is that the human eye is an extension of the nervous system, which is the second most lipid- and cholesterol-concentrated tissue type next to adipose tissue in the human body. The lenses of mammals, but particularly the human lens, is extremely stable due in part to its cholesterol content. Amazingly, this is why the only reported lipid remaining in a frozen mammoth 40,000 years after its death was from its lens membranes.<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/cholesterol-drugs-linked-eye-damage-jama-study-confirms-anew-0#_ftn3">[3]</a> Therefore, given the crucial role that cholesterol plays as a structural and functional biomolecule within the eye, is it any wonder that cholesterol-inhibiting drugs adversely affect them?<br /><br />Also, considering that statin drugs bear a wide range of additional health risks, with over <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/consumer-alert-300-health-problems-linked-statin-drugs">300 known adverse effects</a> associated with their use extensively documented in the biomedical literature [see our<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/guide/health-guide-statin-drugs">Statin Drug database</a>], the reported cardiovascular benefits of this drug class may not be significant enough any longer to justify their use.  To the contrary, the research increasingly indicates that statin drugs are both <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/toxic-ingredient/statin-drugs?ed=44387">muscle-damaging</a> (myotoxic) and <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/toxic-ingredient/statin-drugs?ed=35335">nerve-damaging</a> (neurotoxic) – a concerning<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/toxic-ingredient/statin-drugs?ed=35779">heart-damaging</a> (cardiotoxic) combination, as the heart muscle is a highly nerve-dense muscle.<br /><br />At the very least, patients need to be adequately informed of their risks in order for the medico-ethical principle of informed consent to even be possible.  Failing that, the drug-based default approach in using statin drugs for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease violates the most basic ethical and likely legal rights of their patients.</div><div><br /></div><div>For extensive documentation of the potential adverse health effects of statin drugs, as well as research into scientifically vetted natural alternatives, read any of our recent reports on the topic:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/cholesterol-lowing-statins-found-damage-peripheral-nerves">Cholesterol Lowing Statins Found To Damage Peripheral Nerves</a></li><li><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/statin-drugs-found-accelerate-arterial-calcification">Statin Drugs Found To Accelerate Arterial Calcification</a></li><li><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/statin-drugs-linked-arthritis-heart-trouble-and-more">Statin Drugs Linked To Arthritis, Heart Trouble And More</a></li><li><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/confirmed-again-statin-drugs-calcify-coronary-arteries1">Confirmed Again: Statin Drugs Calcify The Coronary Arteries</a></li><li><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/statins-provide-no-benefit-study-4-million-people">Statins Provide No Benefit: Study of 4 Million People</a></li><li><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/cholesterol-lowering-statins-may-kill-omega-3-heart-benefits">Are Statin Drugs Killing The Health Benefits Of Omega-3 Fat?</a></li><li><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/new-greek-name-statin-toxicity-polymyalgia-rheumatica">A New Greek Name for Statin Toxicity: Polymyalgia Rheumatica</a></li><li><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/statins-raise-diabetes-risk-48-postmenopausal-women">Statins Raise Diabetes Risk by 48% for Postmenopausal Women</a></li><li><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/statin-drugs-linked-worsening-osteoarthritis-knee-0">Statin Drugs Linked To Worsening Osteoarthritis Of The Knee</a></li><li><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/sugarcane-extract-superior-cholesterol-lowering-drugs">Sugarcane Extract Superior To Cholesterol-Lowering Drugs?</a></li><li><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/chocolate-gives-statins-29-billion-run-their-money">Chocolate Gives Statins A $29 Billion Run For Their Money</a></li><li><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/underreported-dangers-low-cholesterol">How LOW Cholesterol Can Harm Your Health</a></li></ul><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3r6MC2eTURY/UF4PWCetL1I/AAAAAAAARz0/qsSSnRnWLNQ/s220/200-2.jpg" /></a>There already exists an extensive body of preclinical and even some clinical research on natural cholesterol-lowering substances.

Get your mandatory flu shot or your fired – but don’t worry – it’s FREE!<br /><br />It’s that time of year again.  The propaganda machine is in high gear, churning out the fear in order to get everyone lined up for their annual flu shots.   Widely trusted websites like the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm">CDC</a>, <a href="http://www.flu.gov/prevention-vaccination/vaccination/">Flu.gov</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/flu-shots/ID00017">Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;are all trumpeting the necessity of this year’s vaccination and proclaiming it to be the best way to stay healthy.</div><div><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br />The CDC (Centers for Disease Control) held a press conference yesterday (Sept. 26, 2013) in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nfid.org/">National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID)</a> to kick off this year’s vaccine push.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“Our message today is simple,” Dr. Howard Koh, assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “Everyone 6 months of age and older should receive a flu vaccine.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">The good news, according to the government health agency, is that more kids and health care workers got vaccinated during last year’s flu season, compared to previous years. That’s key, because children and people with preexisting health conditions are at higher risk for more serious cases of flu.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">But, those positive trends are not going to put the brakes on the CDC’s efforts to tout the vaccines, especially among some high-risk groups still lagging in coverage rates.<br />“Despite substantial progress, we can do even more to make our country healthier through prevention,” said Koh. “We must do everything possible now to be prepared.” (<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-204_162-57604776/cdc-flu-vaccination-rates-lagging-in-pregnant-women-nursing-home-employees/">source</a>)</blockquote>This year the focus is on pregnant women and people who are employed at long term health care facilities.  Don’t be surprised to see another rash of “get your flu shot or lose your job” ultimatums for nursing home workers.  Last year, workplaces, schools and other activities across the US and Canada instituted policies that forced all participants to receive a flu shot.-<a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/01/several-nurses-fired-for-refusing-toxic.html">Long term hospital employees were fired</a> for refusing to have the toxin injected into themselves.  Children were banned from pre-schools and daycares in 6 states.  Nursing students were told to have the shot or lose their placements, thus disqualifying them for their degrees. The media and government launched a full-out propaganda assault to force those who didn’t want it to have the flu shot anyway, at risk of their livelihoods and educations.<br /><br />What the propagandists and flu shot proponents fail to mention are the horror stories – like the fact that 23 senior citizens (in that touted high-risk-must-get-a-shot group) just DIED from the same flu shots that are given at local pharmacies, with no accountability, no prescription necessary, and no check up from the doctor. (But you DO get a handy 20% off shopping pass when you get your flu shot!)<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Package inserts for flu vaccines show a multitude of side effects, including death, and yet they are marketed the same as over-the-counter drugs with no prescription needed. Why?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Because in the United States vaccines enjoy complete immunity from lawsuits in the market place. If you are injured or die from a vaccine, you or your family cannot sue the manufacturer of the vaccine. This law enacted by Congress, was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Therefore, they are marketed with the same marketing techniques as any other high-profit product. With the baby boomer generation moving into their senior years, today’s seniors are seen as an especially lucrative market. (<a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2013/23-seniors-died-after-receiving-this-years-flu-shot-sold-by-pharmacies/">source</a>)</blockquote>Flu shots mean big money to the pharmacies, to the doctors, and to the drug companies.  The frenzy with which the flu shot is promoted is directly proportionate to the profit margin, but those lining their pockets fail to mention that you could be paying them to give you and your family a lethal injection.<br /><div><br /><b>Why I Won’t Get a Flu Shot</b><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8n0lSATEOvA/UHClnvZ78iI/AAAAAAAAAI4/_hdaYp5kbtA/s250/legal-vaccine.jpg" style="background-image: none; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: none;" /></a><br />My first thought when the government absolutely insists that I do something is, “Heck no.”<br /><br />Call me a conspiracy theorist if you want to – I’m cool with that – but the insistence of the powers that be that my family and I be injected with foreign substances that have not been proven to be effective and that have mild to severe side effects makes me plain suspicious.<br /><br />My family and I will not be getting a flu shot this year (or any other year) for 5 reasons.  (Check out last year’s article, <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/five-reasons-why-ill-never-get-a-flu-shot-01122013">5 Reasons Why I’ll Never Get a Flu Shot</a>, for more details on each of these reasons.)<br /><ul><li><b>It <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/037323_flu_vaccines_junk_science_toxicity.html">doesn’t work</a>.</b></li><li><b>There are horrible toxic ingredients in the vaccine.</b></li><li><b>There is a risk of mild to horrific side effects.</b></li><li><b>I don’t trust the <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/the-sinister-corporate-agenda-of-the-fda-04142012">FDA</a>, the CDC, or the AMA – they work for the benefit of the government and Big Business – not for the benefit of the public.</b></li><li><b>If the mainstream media is constantly endorsing it, I refuse to participate because they are known propagandists and mouthpieces for advertisers and political agendas.</b></li></ul>Just like with any other sales pitch, the more insistent the salesman and the less information they want to give you about the product, the faster you should run the other direction.<br /><br /><b>But…Isn’t the Shot the Best Way to Prevent Catching the Flu?</b><br /><br />You will hear in about 10,971 variations that “The best way to prevent catching the flu is to receive your annual flu shot.”<br /><br />This is actually untrue.<br /><br /><b>The absolute, number one way to avoid catching the flu is through the exercise of good personal hygiene.</b><br /><b><br /></b> 1. Wash your hands frequently when you are out.<br /><br />2. Use a paper towel to open bathroom doors and turn on taps.<br /><br />3. Although I’m normally not a big fan of hand sanitizer, use it during the height of flu season if you have to touch things that everyone else has been touching, like the handle of the shopping cart, door knobs, and debit machines.<br /><br />4. Use antibacterial wipes (or at least baby wipes) to wash your hands and wipe the steering wheel when you get back into your vehicle.<br /><br />5. Avoid touching your face – this welcomes germs that are on your hands into your body.<br /><br />6. During the height of flu season, consider taking a quick shower and changing clothes when you return home, particularly if you have been in a germ-ridden place like a doctor’s office or pharmacy.<br /><br />7. Make sure the kids change clothes and  thoroughly wash their hands when they return home from school.<br /><br />8. I shouldn’t really have to say this, but….wash your hands after using the bathroom and before preparing or eating food.<br /><br /><b>If your local area is being hit hard by the flu, practice avoidance to keep your family healthy.</b><br /><br />9. Stay home as much as possible. (Obviously, if you have work and school outside the home, this become more difficult, but avoid malls, movie theaters, and sporting events for the duration of the epidemic.)<br /><br />10.  Stay away from sick people if you can.<br /><br />11.  Avoid eating at restaurants – you don’t know the health or hygiene habits of the kitchen staff.<br /><br /><b>If someone in your family is sick, try to minimize the spread of the illness.</b><br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N2GOFRKd8Vs/UF4PWWZ5dsI/AAAAAAAARz4/tuwcrewmlWA/s316/herbalcures.png" style="background-image: none; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: none;" width="160" /></a>12.  If you or a family member are sick, stay home from work or school to prevent passing it on to others.<br /><br />13.  If a family member is sick, keep them isolated away from the rest of the family.<br /><br />14.  Use antibacterial wipes to clean surfaces that the sick person touches – doorknobs, TV remotes, keyboards, toilet handles, and phones.<br /><br />15. Immediate place dishes and flatware used by the sick person into hot, soapy dishwater with a drop of bleach in it.<br /><br />16.  Teach children to cough into the crook of their arm instead of covering their mouth with their hands.<br /><br />17.  Have the sick person wash their hands frequently with soap and water to help prevent spreading germs through physical contact. If soap and water is unavailable, have them use hand sanitizer.<br /><br /><b>Some other ways to stay healthy are to use natural strategies to maximize your immune system.</b><br /><br />18.  Drink lots of water to keep your system hydrated and efficient.<br /><br />19.  Take a high quality, organic multi-vitamin.<br /><br />20.  Take at least 3000 IUs of <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/12/14/study-shows-vitamin-d-cuts-flu-by-nearly-50.aspx">Vitamin D3 daily</a> - research has shown a link between a <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/2008/10/donald-w-miller-jr-md/dont-get-a-flu-shot-2/">Vitamin D deficit and susceptibility</a> to the flu.<br /><br />21.  Eat lots of fruits and vegetables (preferably organic and pesticide free).<br /><br />22.  Get 7-9 hours of sleep per day – a tired body has a weaker immunity against viruses.<br /><br />23.  Don’t smoke – this weakens your resistance against respiratory illnesses and worsens the effect on your body if you do become ill.<br /><br />24.  Avoid or limit alcoholic beverages.<br /><br />25.  Avoid or limit processed foods.<br /><br /><b>Should You Head to the Pharmacy If You Get the Flu?</b><br /><br />If, despite all of your precautions, you do get sick, you don’t have to resort to over-the-counter remedies and prescription antivirals.  These can have horrendous side effects and are rarely effective.<br /><br />Check out&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/avoid-the-pharmacy-fight-the-flu-with-remedies-from-the-kitchen-01092013">this article</a> to learn more about the treatments from the pharmacy and discover some effective remedies that are as close as your kitchen.<br /><br />As well, consider investing in <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/elderberry-extract-natures-tamiflu-01212013">nature’s version of Tamiflu – elderberry extract</a>.  Scientists have isolated the active compound in the elderberry.  It is called Antivirin and is found in proteins of the black elderberry.  The compound prevents the flu virus from invading the membranes of  healthy cells.<br /><br />If you are sick, increase your levels of Vitamin D3 to medicinal level doses – it has been proven to reduce the time and severity of flu symptoms – learn more about this <a href="http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/newsletter/newsletter-h1n1-flu-and-vitamin-d/">treatment option from the Vitamin D Council</a> (the information on Vitamin D is great but sadly the article contains flu shot and Tamiflu propaganda – so, take the beneficial information and mentally set aside the rest.)<br /><br />The worst case scenario is that you do, indeed, contract the flu. Despite the hullabaloo, you are probably not going to die, be hospitalized, or suffer horrific permanent damage from a bout of the flu. People get sick, but death from the seasonal flu is rare.  This manufactured panic over flu prevention is agenda-based.  Big Pharma wants money and Big Government wants control.<br /><br />I don’t believe that all health care professionals and flu-shot advocates have ill-intent.  I think that many of them have just sipped the mainstream media Kool-aid – the tale-spinners of Big Pharma have slipped in just enough truth to make their theories believable.  Most people are deep-down decent and have difficulty believing that such a perverse money/power agenda could exist.<br /><br />I’ll take the risk of illness that my healthy immune system can fight off over the risk of being forcibly inoculated with whatever toxins the creators of these vaccines choose to include.

But it hasn’t. The US Food and Drug Administration checks for safety of the vaccine, but not for efficacy. <b>There is no evidence that the vaccine protects against cervical cancer</b>, only [that it] counters the virus itself. No decrease in invasive cervical cancer… in the vaccinated population has been documented so far. [emphasis added]</blockquote><i>“One would have thus have to vaccinate 20,000 girls to prevent one case.” — Dr. Uzi Beller, gynecologist</i><br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>Beller testified at a meeting of 40 specialists in oncology, gynecology, vaccines and women’s health regarding HPV vaccines in Tel Aviv earlier this month. The Israeli Health Ministry was set to begin a widescale vaccination program of 65,000 14-year-old Israeli school girls this fall, but the program has been halted for further review after multiple doctors have come forward voicing concerns that these vaccines’ scant potential benefits do not outweigh the myriad adverse health effects the HPV vaccine can — and has — caused.<br /><br />Beller went on to note:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">HPV is different from all other vaccines. It is not a vaccination against cervical cancer but against a virus that in some cases causes a premalignant condition, and in a small number of cases, a malignancy. In a year in Israel, there are 180 cases of cervical cancer, and half [of those with the disease] die of it. [This] is a rate of five per 100,000 residents – the lowest rate of cervical cancer in the world. <b>One would have thus have to vaccinate 20,000 girls to prevent one case. </b>[emphasis added]</blockquote>Big Pharma company Merck (Gardasil), and GlaxoSmithKline (Cervarix), <a href="http://www.fiercevaccines.com/special-reports/merck">raked in billions</a> on their HPV vaccines last year, most likely on the fears of concerned parents and patients under 30 who paid nearly $400 for a set of three shots to try and spare their adolescents or themselves from possibly getting HPV-related diseases like cervical cancer and genital warts.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, as <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/01/24/hpv-vaccine-averting-cancer-%20unproven.aspx">other doctors have pointed out</a> in the past, <i><b>HPV vaccines do not prevent cancer.</b></i><br /><br />In fact, Gardasil only claims to protect those vaccinated with it from four of more than 100 strands of human papilloma virus and even if someone were to contract one of those strands, it does not automatically mean that person will even get cancer, regardless of Merck’s aggressive marketing campaigns based entirely on fear of it.<br /><br />Even <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/07/lead-gardasil-vaccine-creator-confesses.html">one of the top</a> scientists that helped create Gardasil came forward to admit that the incidents of cervical cancer in the U.S. are already very low and, because the majority of HPV cases resolve themselves within one (70%) or two (90%) years’ time, the vaccine really will not have an effect on the cervical cancer rates either way.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200" /></a>On top of that, more than 30,000 adverse events have been reported since these vaccines were approved for sale, a much higher number than the estimated 12,000 cases of cervical cancer reported annually in America. The National Vaccine Injury Program recently paid $6 million to Gardasil victims. Negative side effects reported include Guillain-Barre syndrome, seizures, severe pain, fatigue syndrome, tremors, infertility, spontaneous miscarriage and even death. Over 60 people have died so far after getting the HPV vaccine.<br /><br />Recently, the <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/japan-stops-administering-hpv-vaccines-citing-adverse-effects-3/">Japanese government has announced</a> it will officially stop recommending HPV shots due over 2,000 adverse reactions reported in the country. Any Japanese healthcare provider will now be required to tell patients that the government does not recommend the vaccine.<br /><br />HPV vaccines were fast-tracked, and their approval marks one of the most corrupt and obvious revolving door cases in the history of the U.S. government. The former U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director from 2002 to 2009 <a href="http://vactruth.com/2010/01/04/julie-gerberding-primed-big-pharmas-pump-with-flu-and-hpv-vaccines/">Dr. Julie Gerberding</a> directly helped pave the way for approval of Merck’s Gardasil vaccine with a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/HPV/2004HPV%20report.pdf">2004 report to Congress on preventing HPV</a>. After she left her position at the CDC in 2009, Dr. Gerberding walked right through the revolving door between our government and Big Pharma <i>to accept a position as President of Merck’s Vaccine Division</i> where she currently works.<br /><br />Dr. Beller went on to assert he is not even against taking vaccines himself, he just holds deep reservations specifically about the efficacy of HPV vaccines:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">I am not at all against vaccines. I just underwent the oral polio vaccination as the Health Ministry instructed medical institutions to give the two drops to every doctor who is in direct contact with patients…if the vaccine prevented cervical cancer, I would be in favor. The vaccine [was hailed] in 2003 as being ‘the beginning of the end for cervical cancer,’ but it was exaggerated.</blockquote><i><a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/author/melissa-melton/">MELISSA MELTON</a>&nbsp;is a co-founder of <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/">TruthstreamMedia.com</a>, where <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/another-doctor-testifies-hpv-vaccine-does-not-protect-against-cancer/" target="_blank">this article first appeared</a>.

They are the strongest and stiffest materials yet discovered – hundreds of times stronger than steel but six times lighter – and their unique mechanical, electrical, thermal and transport properties present exciting opportunities for research and development. They are already used in a variety of industries including in electronics, sports equipment, long-lasting batteries, sensing devices and wind turbines.<br /><br />The University of Adelaide's Nanotech Research Group has 'grown' the carbon nanotubes onto nanoporous alumina membranes. They used pieces of grocery plastic bags which were vaporized in a furnace to produce carbon layers that line the pores in the membrane to make the tiny cylinders (the carbon nanotubes). The idea was conceived and carried out by PhD student Tariq Altalhi.<br /><br />"Initially we used ethanol to produce the carbon nanotubes," says Professor Losic. "But my student had the idea that any carbon source should be useable."<br /><br />The huge potential market for carbon nanotubes hinges on industry's ability to produce large quantities more cheaply and uniformly. Current synthesis methods usually involve complex processes and equipment, and most companies on the market measure production output in only several grams per day.<br /><br />"In our laboratory, we've developed a new and simplified method of fabrication with controllable dimensions and shapes, and using a waste product as the carbon source," says Professor Losic.<br /><br />The process is also catalyst and solvent free, which means the plastic waste can be used without generating poisonous compounds.<br /><br />This research has been published online ahead of print in the journal&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008622313006246">Carbon</a>.<br /><br /><i>Image credit: Wikimedia Commons.</i><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/stirlinggenerator.html" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wUW7ELYg6bs/UCEoWeeuKhI/AAAAAAAARNE/BN18j9KCgls/s468/038_468x60.gif" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://www.naturalblaze.com/2013/09/scientists-recycle-plastic-bags-into.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"noreply@blogger.com (Activist Post)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2013-09-25T21:29:54.784-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:92:"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h5uYlgOzGlQ/UkO30H95slI/AAAAAAAABrE/NqKJBwXMtNU/s72-c/Graphene.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4446947302163364668.post-6048652908962729957";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 00:30:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"food self-sufficiency";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"prepping-gear";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"organic-kitchen";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"food storage";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Daisy-Luther";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"pantry";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"The Pantry Primer: 12 Strategies to Build the Ultimate Pantry";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12563:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lYP9Cxod-As/UkMzsNurLAI/AAAAAAAACpo/imVvnKRW_us/s1600/12-Strategies-to-Build-the-Ultimate-Pantry-300x268.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="286" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lYP9Cxod-As/UkMzsNurLAI/AAAAAAAACpo/imVvnKRW_us/s320/12-Strategies-to-Build-the-Ultimate-Pantry-300x268.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>By <a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/search/label/Daisy-Luther" target="_blank">Daisy Luther</a><br /><br />In every relationship there comes a time when you have to sit down and take a serious look at the future. Where do you want to go? Are your goals compatible? Are things working as they stand right now or do some changes need to be made?<br /><br />Your pantry is no different. People create food storage stockpiles for many different reasons, and because of this, there is no “one-size-fits-all” formula for doing so. You must figure out what your goals are and develop a road map towards achieving them.<br /><br />Having a food supply just makes sense. Every time there is a disaster, the masses become hysterical and <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/grid-down-acapulco-theres-nothing-to-eat_09192013">chaos ensues</a> because there is no food available because of our <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/emergency-preparedness/just-in-time-when-the-trucks-stop-america-will-stop-with-immediate-and-catastrophic-consequences_04022012">“just-in-time” food delivery system</a>. Your stockpile can mean the difference between <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/how-many-buckets-of-freedom-do-you-have-02252013">continued freedom</a> and bowing down to your “masters” for a cold MRE and a bottle of water.<br /><div><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br /><br />There are three basic types of food supplies. Learn about these food storage ideologies and then take the most applicable strategies and combine them to create your own version of the Ultimate Pantry.<br /><div><br /><b>The Bunker Pantry</b><br /><br />This is the most “hardcore” of the food storage types. A Bunker Pantry is the type of food supply that could keep you going for the next ten years without a single trip to the store. Sure, it might be a little bit boring and lacking in variety, but it is a supply that will see you through any disaster that allows you to remain in your shelter. This type of pantry focuses on huge quantities of long-term foods, repackaged carefully to resist spoilage due to pests or the elements.<br /><br />If this is the type of pantry you’d like to build, focus on staples such as wheat, rice, dried beans, salt, and sugar. Check out this article on <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/11-emergency-food-items-that-can-last-a-lifetime_20082013/">11 Emergency Food Items That Can Last a Lifetime</a> for more suggestions. These foods can be purchased in bulk and <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/are-you-ready-series-best-practices-for-long-term-food-storage_03042011/">repackaged by the user</a>, or you can purchase them already packaged up through vendors like the LDS warehouse or online food storage websites.<br /><br />Variety can be added to this type of pantry through commercially canned fruits, vegetables, and meats. When looking for sales on these items, be sure to check the expiration dates. If you are storing for the long-term you want to be certain to grab cans with the longest shelflife.<br /><br />Another great way to add fruits, veggies, meats, and dairy to your Bunker Pantry is through the <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/fun-with-freeze-dried-food_20072012/">addition of freeze-dried foods</a>. If properly packaged, these foods can last up to 25 years. As long as you have water to rehydrate these foods, your diet can remain fairly normal throughout a long-term scenario. Imagine rehydrating the ingredients to make a fluffy cheese omelet with ham and peppers!<br /><br />It takes a lot of space to store this much food, so generally a dedicated area must be used as a storeroom. Items should be clearly marked with expiration dates, and when that date draws near, the items should be rotated in to the family’s kitchen.</div><div><br /><b>The Agrarian Pantry</b><br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/eatingforenergy.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-a9RumH9MTrA/UVM5JJPpQgI/AAAAAAAAUmU/FtWuG4pfgpc/s200/200-2.jpg" /></a>This type of pantry is the kind our ancestors had. Most of the purchases are made during the growing season and only small shopping trips are needed to supplement this throughout the year. It combines enough basic staples for the year ahead with enough of your preserved harvest to get you through the next growing season. (This is the type of pantry that we keep in our family, with a few of the other strategies added to increase the usefulness of our stockpile.)<br /><br />To build an Agrarian Pantry, stock up on a year’s supply of basics like grains, baking items, tea, coffee, and dried beans. Then focus your efforts on acquiring items in season and preserving them when they are at their peak. Try your hand at canning, dehydrating, and <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/how-to-create-a-root-cellar-for-food-storage-09142013">root cellaring</a>. Items can be grown on your own property or purchased by the bushel from local farms and orchards.<br /><br />Look into purchasing a side of beef and a side of pork to add to your pantry. One purchase per year is sufficient for most families, and your price per pound drops dramatically when you buy meat in this type of quantity. Don’t put all your faith in the deep freezer, however, because a grid-down scenario could leave you with a smelly mess and a large lost investment. Try canning, smoking, salting and dehydrating for the bulk of your meat purchases.<br /><br />This type of pantry must be replenished every year. Basically, the items in your pantry are purchased and put back with the intention of consuming them within the next 12 months.</div><div><br /><b>The Bargain-Hunter’s Pantry</b><br /><br />This is the type of pantry made famous by the extreme couponing shows. Using a variety of strategies, people can amass an enormous quantity of food for very little money. Couponing, sale shopping, bartering, and buying from outlet stores and warehouses can help to create a pantry full of packaged items.<br /><br />While this is a great way to get started or to supplement your other strategies, this is my least favorite way to create a stockpile. This is simply for two reasons: much of what you are acquiring is <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/nutrition-101-how-processed-foods-make-us-fat-malnourished-and-sick-06222013">highly processed</a>, and without a lot of personal discipline, you aren’t building a balanced pantry, but just stockpiling whatever is the cheapest. If you use this method, you must be extremely careful not to end up with a pantry full of carbs, but no protein or fruits and veggies. (25 cent ketchup is NOT a vegetable)<br /><br />Warnings aside, you can build up a huge amount of food on a very limited budget and still be careful if you are a smart shopper. Read <a href="http://momwithaprep.com/2013/09/04/build-better-pantry-use-coupons-help-prepare-emergencies/">THIS</a> and <a href="http://momwithaprep.com/2013/09/09/build-better-pantry-use-sales-cycles-help-prepare-emergencies/">THIS</a> to learn how.<br /><br />When building a Bargain Hunter’s Pantry, consider the following suggestions to create more balance:<br /><ul><li>Look for the items with the least number of ingredients – don’t stock your shelves with chemistry projects, no matter how cheap they are.</li><li>Strive for balance by creating an inventory list to keep in your purse so that you know which types off foods are needed to keep your family healthy. (Are you short of protein sources? Veggies? Healthy fats?)</li><li>Don’t add it to your stockpile merely because it’s cheap, particularly if your storage space is limited.</li><li>Be sure to rotate the items into you kitchen by expiry date. Often the items that have the deepest discounts are the closest to expiration. You aren’t saving money if you end up throwing out spoiled food.</li></ul><b>Combine the Best of Each Strategy to Build the Ultimate Pantry</b><br /><br />The Ultimate Pantry combines the three strategies listed above to create the optimal supply for the needs of your particular family.<br /><br />The key is organization. Keep the following tips in mind to create the best possible pantry.<br /><ol><li>Keep an up-to-date inventory so that you know what you have.</li><li>Catalog your coupons by type and expiration date.</li><li>Track the sales cycles.</li><li>Keep your products rotated into your kitchen so that you don’t lose foods to missed expiration dates.</li><li>Store longer term foods in optimum conditions to prolong their viability.</li><li>Maintain a list of what is needed to balance your pantry nutritionally so that you can focus on those items when an unexpected bargain pops up.</li><li>Buy pantry staples (like beans in grains) in the largest quantities you can manage in order to maximize your savings.</li><li>Remember the adage “Store what you eat and eat what you store” – it isn’t a bargain if you purchase something no one in your family will eat.</li><li>Supplement your pantry by growing as much as possible in your particular circumstances, even if you are just adding a windowsill herb and salad garden.</li><li>Tap into your inner hunter-gatherer with strategies like foraging, fishing, snaring, and hunting.</li><li>Purchase seasonally and in large quantities from local growers (or harvest from your own gardens).</li><li>Become a food preservation expert and stock up on the necessary tools and supplies.</li></ol>What strategies do you use to build your own pantries?

These products can be quite expensive and more often than not, contain harsh chemicals. Many of these chemicals are easily absorbed into the skin and have cancer-causing properties.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Why not eliminate as many of these products as possible? Each one of these is designed to treat a certain ‘problem,’ while it is probably creating another in its tracks. If these products were actually made to heal or provide the benefits that they are being marketed for, these companies wouldn’t make nearly as much money. So, maybe it is time that we looked into some safer, more simple and cheaper methods of skin care, such as rosewater.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br />Rosewater is a concoction that is made of just that- roses and water, it is a by-product from distilling rose petals and water to make rose oil. It has been used as a beauty product for millennia. It has been found that Cleopatra enjoyed taking baths with many rose petals in the water, and making facial masks made from rose petals. Rosewater has been known for its many different healing properties for a very long time, particularly when it comes to skin care.<br /><br />Rosewater helps to maintain the skins natural ph. balance, which can guard against various diseases and eczema. Rosewater is wonderful because it is very versatile and can be used to treat dry wrinkled skin to oily acne prone skin.  It prevents aging by tightening skin pores and even reducing wrinkles! Rosewater is also extremely hydrating so it works great as a moisturizer. This amazing concoction also has anti-septic properties and makes a great cleanser, removing oil, dirt and other contaminants that reside deep within the skins pores. All around this is a great all natural beauty product that can replace your cleanser, toner and moisturizer! You get all three in one. Although aside from skin care, this sweet smelling water has many other health benefits.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/eatingforenergy.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NXBnYCOlwMY/UVM5JONZ6bI/AAAAAAAAUmY/Vf3sgEPfneI/s200/200-3.jpg" /></a>There are many products on the market that contain rosewater, but make sure you watch out for fake products that contain artificial rose smell that are marketed as rosewater or rose oil. Your best option is to purchase these products from a health store, and make sure to read the ingredients on the labels. It is best to get all natural, plant-based (organic if possible) products, remember, what goes on your body goes in your body. Some of the products might be quite expensive, so alternatively, you can make your own. Rosewater extract is readily available and easy to find. To make your own cleansers you can start off with a base plain unscented cleanser such as Dr. Bronner’s or something similar and just add the rose water directly to this. After I wash my face, I take an organic cotton pad and soak it in a diluted mixture of rosewater extract and wipe it over my entire face, paying close attention to my eyes, leaving it on each eye a few moments longer. I don’t even bother to use moisturizer after this because I find my skin feels very soft and hydrated after this step, because the rosewater itself is extremely moisturizing.<br /><br />I should add, that rose oil is also extremely beneficial for the skin, and is most likely more potent because it is much more concentrated than rose water, however it is quite a bit more expensive and from my own personal experience the rosewater works very well anyways. I have watched many large pores and acne scars shrink, fine lines disappear and my skin becomes naturally softer and  vibrant looking. After I began using the rosewater I wondered where has this beautiful liquid been all my life? It leaves such a sweet smell behind as well.<br /><br />It is no wonder that this product has been used so much over the years, and the more advanced we are becoming the more we are realizing that sometimes it is better to go back to the basics, back to our history, it’s amazing how something so simple is much more beneficial.<br /><br />Learn how to make your own rosewater here:<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="370" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/JT8TZfqeCtw?feature=player_embedded" width="565"></iframe> <br /><br />Much Love<br /><br /><b>Sources:</b><br /><br /><a href="http://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/health-benefits-of-rose-essential-oil.html">http://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/health-benefits-of-rose-essential-oil.html </a><br /><br /><a href="http://letsgohealthy.blogspot.ca/2012/12/benefits-of-rose-water-for-health-and.html">http://letsgohealthy.blogspot.ca/2012/12/benefits-of-rose-water-for-health-and.html</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.gulsha.com.tr/en/rose-damascena/history-of-rose-water.aspx">http://www.gulsha.com.tr/en/rose-damascena/history-of-rose-water.aspx</a><br /><br /><i><a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/author/alanna/">Alanna Ketler</a> is a longtime contributor to Collective-Evolution, where this <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/09/23/the-benefits-of-rosewater-for-beautiful-healthy-skin/">article first appeared</a></i><br /><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

So, is it any wonder that this deregulated and increasingly deranged juggernaut is experimenting on its own customer base by exposing them to trillions of toxic nanoparticles?<br /><br />A new study published in <i>Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy</i> titled, "<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/carcinogenic-effects-titanium-dioxide-nanoparticles-human-gastric-epithelial">Effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in human gastric epithelial cells in vitro</a>," reveals for the first time that the nanoparticle form of the common "whitening" agent known as titanium dioxide is capable of inducing "tumor-like" changes in exposed human cells.<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/why-food-industry-poisoning-us-trillions-nanoparticles-1#_ftn1">[1]</a><br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>Whereas previous cell research has established that titanium dioxide (TiO2) is cytotoxic (cell damaging),<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/why-food-industry-poisoning-us-trillions-nanoparticles-1#_ftn2">[2]</a> this is the first study of its kind to find exposed cells undergo a 'phenotypal' transition from normal to cancerous cell traits, including an increased rate of cell proliferation and a decrease in programmed cell death – hallmark features of precancerous and/or cancerous cells associated with 'immortalization.'<br /><br />Owing to the fact that the researchers tested human gastric epithelial cells, a type of stomach cell in direct contact with material we eat, and considering the broad range of drug, personal care and food products nanoparticle TiO2 is commonly used within, the toxicological implications of these findings are deeply concerning.<br /><div><br /><b>We Are Already Eating Titanium Dioxide</b><br /><br />TiO2 is a naturally occurring oxide of titanium, and has a wide range of industrial applications as a "whitening" pigment in plastics, ceramic glazes and paints. It is used in sunscreens as a UV absorbing "sun protection factor," due to its high refractive index.  Most of our risk of exposure comes from its use in toothpaste, drugs and excipient-heavy supplements as a pill coating, and food products, including even milk (to 'improve' appearance and texture).<br /><br />Indeed, given that TiO2 is found in thousands of consumer products, the odds are that you are already being exposed to a significant quantity of them on a daily basis.  As reported by<a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-and-nutrition/0312/nanoparticles-affect-nutrition-researchers-warn.aspx">Everydayhealth.com</a>, "You ingest around 100 <i>trillion</i> nanoparticles every day, researchers at Binghamton University and Cornell University say."<br /><br />So, what are some common brands who use it? Nanotitanium is found in products produced by Jello, Nestlé, M&amp;M's, Mother's, Mentos, Albertson's, Hostess and Kool Aid. <br /><br />Below is a table from the 2012 E Magazine article "<a href="http://www.emagazine.com/magazine/eating-nano">Eating Nano</a>" revealing its presence in common U.S. packaged goods.<br /><br /><img height="352" src="http://cdn.greenmedinfo.com/sites/default/files/ckeditor/Sayer%20Ji/images/nanofoods_chart_large.jpg" width="640" /><br /><b>Is Titanium Dioxide Regulated?</b><br /><br />Much like present day radiobiological risk assessments for technologies like <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/x-ray-mammography">mammography</a> were developed <i>long before the discovery of DNA</i>, making it impossible to comprehend their DNA-damaging properties at that time, present day biosafety regulations of TiO2 were determined long before the advent of <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>.  In both cases, the true harms of these technologies were -- and still are -- greatly underestimated.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/eatingforenergy.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NXBnYCOlwMY/UVM5JONZ6bI/AAAAAAAAUmY/Vf3sgEPfneI/s200/200-3.jpg" /></a>As a result of this information gap, TiO2 is currently classified as 'generally recognized as safe' (GRAS) by the FDA, regardless of format. Remarkably, the FDA still allows titanium dioxide in <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/toxic-ingredient/sunscreen">sunscreens</a> "at concentrations of up to 25 percent alone and 2 to 25 percent in combination with any proposed Category I sunscreen active ingredient" without considering the toxicity differential of particle size.<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/why-food-industry-poisoning-us-trillions-nanoparticles-1#_ftn3">[3]</a>Considering that concentrations as low as 0.001% by weight have been found to exhibit clear cytotoxicity within exposed cells,<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/why-food-industry-poisoning-us-trillions-nanoparticles-1#_ftn4">[4]</a> the biosafety regulations governing TiO2  are as great as 5 orders of <i>magnitude</i> or higher less stringent than they should be to protect the consumer.<br /><br />Nanoparticles are so small they are below the threshold of visibility. This is one reason why they are used for sun protection factor, as 100 nanometers or smaller particles will not leave the white pasty appearance on the skin associated with larger particles.  What you can't see, however, <i>is still there </i>– and in the case of nanotitanium, may slip through the surface layers of our skin into more sensitive tissues, as well as our blood stream. This is also why, if you use sunscreen, you should make sure the ingredients say "non-nanoparticle" when describing titanium dioxide or zinc oxide. And this rule applies to purportedly 'natural' brands as well.<br /><br />Technically, a nanoparticle, also known as a 'ultrafine particle,' is a particle that is sized within the nanometer scale: literally, anywhere between 1-100 billionth (nano) of a meter in diameter.  Going up in scale, larger particles are known as 'fine particles,' sized between 2,500 and 100 nanometers, and so-called 'coarse particles' are sized between 10,000 and 2,500 nanometers.<br /><div><br /><b>How 'Smaller' Can Indicate A Much Larger Problem</b><br /><br />Nanotechnology inverts the unsophisticated logic of conventional toxicology risk assessments: namely, that the smaller the amount of something (concentration or size), the less harmful it is. We have seen how this logic has failed with petrochemical-derived chemicals like <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/toxic-ingredient/benzene">benzene</a>, considered toxic in the parts-per-trillion range, and endocrine disrupters like <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/toxic-ingredient/bisphenol">bisphenol A</a> and <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/toxic-ingredient/parabens">parabens</a>, which exert powerful hormone-mimicking properties that sometimes increase as their concentration decrease.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oBYhzykle4E/UF4PWSOj_EI/AAAAAAAARz8/IxYhUqLJB9M/s220/200.jpg" /></a>More recently, Monsanto's Roundup herbicide (<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/toxic-ingredient/glyphosate">glyphosate</a>), was found to exhibit estrogenicity (and concomitant carcinogenicity) in the <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/breaking-glyphosate-roundup-carcinogenic-parts-trillion-range">parts-per-trillion concentration range</a>. There is also the case of so-called 'low dose' radioisotopes such as <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/toxic-ingredient/uranium-depleted">depleted uranium</a>, whose relatively low radiolytic decay relative to gamma-ray emitting plutonium generates the illusion that it is safer (<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/depleted-uranium-uranium-238-has-been-shown-induce-adverse-cellular-changes">recent research</a>performed by the U.S. Army's own Radiobiological Research Institute indicates these "lower risk" radiation sources cause up to a million-fold more damage than present risk models explain due to a phenomenon known as the photoelectic effect).<br /><br />In other words, less is not only more, but when it comes to particle size, <b>smaller sizes often convey exponentially higher toxicity than larger ones.</b><br /><div><br /><b>Why Are We Not Being Protected?</b><br /><br />So, why isn't more being done to protect the consumer from the clear and present health threat represented by nanotechnology? Considering that the Food and Drug Administration does exactly that: administers and/or executes the interests of the <u>food</u> and <u>drug</u> manufacturers, we are supplicating to the wrong entity. The FDA is at least consistent by deciding to allow the food industry to govern itself, but what about the food industry's liability in saturating our food supply with trillions of nanoparticles per serving, without warning the consumer?<br /><br />According to Tom Philpot, writing for <a href="http://grist.org/article/2010-04-02-lunchroom-drama-nanotech-follies-and-other-tasty-bites/">Grist in 2010</a>, <b>"As with GMOs, the strategy seems to be: release into the food supply en masse first; assess risks later (if ever)."</b><br /><br />This strategy, while a seemingly successful short-term business model for nanotechnology stakeholders, is utter insanity when one considers the long-term fall out it will have on the industry once millions wake up to the fact they have been treated, once gain, like guinea pigs.<br /><br />Moreover, as a growing body of <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/nanotechnology">peer-reviewed research on the dangers of nanoparticles accumulates</a>, the millions who have already been exposed unknowingly to their ill effects have a legal right to sue for damages.  The food industry's increasingly nefarious stance towards the very consumers who ensure their continued business defies logic, and indicates just how unethical their business model really is.<br /><br />There is really only one answer to this problem. As with unlabeled GMOs, the consumer must refuse to consume them, forcing the manufactures to bow to the holy dollar and reformulate; or, better yet, the 'consumer' must learn how to redefine itself entirely by becoming, once again, a producer, one garden (urban, suburban or rural) at a time. By growing and eating whole foods directly from the earth, we eliminate a wide range of health hazards the mass market food industry has built into their disease-promoting business model.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/why-food-industry-poisoning-us-trillions-nanoparticles-1?page=2#_ftnref1">[1]</a> Monica Catarina Botelho, Carla Costa, Susana Silva, Solange Costa, Alok Dhawan, Paula A Oliveira, João P Teixeira. <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/carcinogenic-effects-titanium-dioxide-nanoparticles-human-gastric-epithelial">Effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in human gastric epithelial cells in vitro.</a> Biomed Pharmacother. 2013 Aug 23.

Just wondering.<br /><br />While shopping for some grocery store produce, we couldn’t help but notice that the organic ginger looked visibly different from the conventionally grown ginger variety, while the former cost right at twice as much. Fortunately, a little ginger goes a long way, so budgeting for organic ginger root usually isn’t a big deal.<br /><br />But just why exactly does the conventional variety – typically subjected to pesticides, fertilizers and other conditions considered unacceptable for organic – appear physically larger, less detailed/textured, shinier (almost in a plasticized way) and otherwise look significantly different from its organic cousin?<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>Melissa put it this way, commenting, “The conventional is all waxy and shiny… as if it’s more likely destined for old lady’s coffee table arrangement rather than someone’s tummy.”<br /><div><br /></div><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="370" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Jt7y0CKQRvs?feature=player_embedded" width="565"></iframe> <br /><div><br />We honestly don’t know why, but a side-by-side look of these two gingers makes you wonder what exactly goes into the superfood. To our knowledge (backed up by a cursory Internet search), there is not currently a genetically-modified version on the market. However, it’s hard to be certain of that these days, and there may be enough concern just with the conventional treatment of one of the world’s foremost medicinal roots.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/organicfood.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TSVu1WxuKgI/AAAAAAAAFpA/qvqvHS98iwY/150x120-set1.gif" /></a>Ginger’s key health benefits are so important, we couldn’t earnestly recommend anyone skip it in their diet, or go cheap and bypass the organic (or perhaps better, local/homegrown source). These <a href="http://health.india.com/diseases-conditions/10-health-benefits-of-ginger/">amazing health benefits include fighting/preventing cancer</a>, easing nausea andmenstrual pain, aiding digestion, alleviating arthritis and headaches and more.<br /><br />Here’s some points to think about with respect to ginger when it comes to conventional vs. organic (and most apply to produce of any kind in general):<br /><br />As <a href="http://thechalkboardmag.com/produce-choosing-organic-local-or-conventional">Chalkboard Magazine explains</a>, “Root vegetables such as ginger, carrots and beets are more susceptible to fertilizers, therefore making organic and/or local the best bet.”<br /><br /><a href="http://www.the-ginger.com/types-of-ginger/organic-ginger">The Ginger blog also recommends</a> organic ginger as well, noting that particularly when using it for its health and medicinal benefits, avoiding conventional could pay off in terms of better effectiveness:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">For everyday cooking use, it may not be too critical to use organic since only a small amount is used for most dishes. However, when consuming a larger amount of it as a natural home remedy for certain ailments, it is wise to use organic. Using organic for ginger tea, made from fresh peeled or unpeeled chunks of the mashed root, assures that your body is assimilating only the natural healing compounds of the root and not any additional artificial chemicals potentially left behind from conventionally grown ginger.</blockquote>It’s reassuring enough to know that some of the most popular varieties of ginger products – The Ginger People brand – have been<i> <a href="http://gingerpeople.com/c/nongmo/">certified non-GMO</a>.</i><br /><br />It is ALSO worth noting, however, that even the iconic “organic/natural” grocer <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/94146/is_your_organic_food_really_organic">Whole Foods once had to pull certified organic ginger that was imported from China</a> after it was discovered that it was contaminated with the insecticide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldicarb">aldicarb</a> – that can “cause nausea, headaches and blurred vision even at low levels” – at levels above those even considered acceptable for conventional produce. Can anything be trusted? Only if it has earned that trust – there are the obvious benefits of growing your own or buying it from a local, known source when possible.<br /><br /><i>ABOUT THE AUTHOR: <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/author/aaron-and-melissa/">AARON DYKES AND MELISSA MELTON</a><br /><br />Aaron and Melissa created TruthstreamMedia.com (<a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/why-does-organic-ginger-look-different-than-conventional/" target="_blank">where this article appeared</a>) as an outlet to examine the news, place it in a broader context, uncover the deceptions, pierce through the fabric of illusions, grasp the underlying factors, know the real enemy, unshackle from the system, and begin to imagine the path towards taking back our lives, one step at a time, so that one day we might truly be free...</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

now it’s cancer.</i><br /><br /><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/conquering-childhood-cancer/story?id=20348929">ABC News</a> is reporting today that cancer has officially outranked every other cause of childhood death in this country:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cancerdeathkids.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="80" src="http://truthstreammedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cancerdeathkids.png" width="550" /></a></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">Cancer is the leading cause of childhood death in the United States, with 13,500 new diagnoses each year according to the American Cancer Institute. One out of every 300 boys and one out of every 333 girls will develop cancer before their 20th birthday, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology.</blockquote>Cancer in America has seen a sharp increase over the last 100 years across all age groups. <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0922292.html">Data</a>&nbsp;from the U.S. Public Health Service estimates that cancer death rates in 1900 were around 64 per 100,000; that number has increased <i>almost threefold</i> to 188.7 per 100,000 in 2005.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-k31JsWHNtfU/UkJG9INAAwI/AAAAAAAABqs/FL5yj3Tep4Y/s1600/cancerdeathchart+(550+x+526).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-k31JsWHNtfU/UkJG9INAAwI/AAAAAAAABqs/FL5yj3Tep4Y/s1600/cancerdeathchart+(550+x+526).jpg" /></a></div><br />In fact, the chances of an American being diagnosed with some type of cancer in his or her lifetime&nbsp;<a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/all.html">is now one in two</a>.<br /><br />This dramatic increase over a relatively short span of time obviously suggests environmental factors are at play here. So why haven’t all these charitable “run for the cure” cancer drives — fundraisers that happen year after year after year as cancer rates only continue to grow — ever cured anything?<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.preventcancer.com/losing/">Cancer Prevention Coalition (CPC)</a> notes that cancer equals big business in this country:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Winning the war on cancer means preventing cancer. Yet cancer is a multi-billion dollar business. Isn’t preventing cancer bad for business? It is for the pharmaceutical and mammography businesses. These industries have intricate ties to U. S. policy makers, directing research funds to ensure their continued profits in cancer diagnosis/treatment.</blockquote>If prevention is key to crushing cancer, then finding out what is actually causing this cancer epidemic from independent studies not funded by the very companies that stand to profit off pointing fingers in the wrong direction is the first step.<br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/stepoutsidethebox.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kADbI3spO2M/TwILKt_It9I/AAAAAAAANvU/F0N-dw_gGR4/s261/cancer.png" /></a><br />What is causing all this cancer, especially the rise in children? Two big factors may be chemicals and electromagnetic radiation.<br /><br />A whopping 70-90% of any average U.S. grocery store is filled with processed foods full of chemical additives and preservatives, many of which are genetically modified, in addition to the fact that a vast majority of U.S. food is tainted with pesticides.<br /><br />The CPC discusses multiple studies that have come to the same conclusion: continual exposure to the multitude of <a href="http://www.preventcancer.com/consumers/food/cancer_toll.htm">carcinogenic pesticides in this country’s food supply</a> is killing our kids:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">As documented by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), residues of numerous carcinogenic pesticides are commonly found in most fruits and vegetables. Additionally, milk and other dairy products are often laden with carcinogenic pesticides and antibiotics. Factory farm meat, particularly liver, veal, frankfurters and hamburgers, are also contaminated with carcinogenic pesticides, besides growth-stimulating sex hormones and other feed additives.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">The Bush [Sr.] Administration has flung open the floodgates to carcinogens in our food. With active support of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has in effect revoked the 1958 Delaney law, which banned intentional contamination of food with any level of carcinogen.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Instead, the EPA now allows residues of any carcinogenic pesticide in any food at levels posing allegedly “acceptable” or “negligible risk,” as determined by manipulated numbers.</blockquote>Should pesticide in our food really ever be considered “acceptable”?<br /><br />Michael Taylor, former Monsanto Vice President for Public Policy and our current Food Safety Czar in this Twilight Zone we all live in, wrote “<a href="http://ijt.sagepub.com/content/7/4/529.citation">The De Minimis Interpretation of the Delaney Clause: Legal and Policy Rationale</a>” advocating a change in the interpretation of the 1958 Delaney Clause back in 1988. On it’s face, Delaney literally stated that no carcinogenic agents could be added to processed foods. Taylor’s interpretation paved the way to altering Delaney to be interpreted so that small amounts of known carcinogens could be added to our food, all without regard to the cumulative negative health effects.<br /><br />Taylor wrote this, by the way, while working at a law firm contracted by Monsanto.<br /><br />Another potential factor is the continual bathing of our growing children’s brains and bodies in electromagnetic radiation (EMR). <a href="http://www.lifeenergysolutions.com/emf/">Estimates</a> show that those of us living in modern-day America are experiencing 100,000,000 times more electromagnetic frequency (EMF) than our grandparents did simply by existing. Incidents of brain tumors have also been found to be higher in Western, developed nations. Everything from cell phones to cell towers going up everywhere to household appliances to computers…even cars emit EMF. Many of these technologies were never tested for potential harmful effects. Research has found <a href="http://www.bcuc.com/Documents/Proceedings/2008/DOC_18756_C3-23_HARLINGTEN_C-Evidence_18.pdf">EMF does have an adverse effect</a> on tissues and cells, and this non-ionizing radiation has been <a href="http://www.bioinitiative.org/report/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/sec11_2012_Use_of_Wireless_Phones.pdf">classified as a carcinogen or potential carcinogen</a>.<br /><br />The top two childhood cancers are leukemia and cancers of the brain and nervous system. Studies have linked both EMF exposure and childhood leukemia (for a few examples, see <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969710003104">here</a>,<a href="http://emrstop.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=66:cancer-incidence-and-mortality-and-proximity-to-tv-towers&amp;catid=25:low-frequency--ac-power-emf-dangers&amp;Itemid=30">here</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610711001076">here</a> and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.27542/full">here</a>), and EMF exposure to childhood brain tumors (see <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/cancer-officially-number-one-cause-of-childhood-death-in-u-s/www.researchgate.net/publication/38091245_Power-frequency_magnetic_fields_and_childhood_brain_tumors_a_case-control_study_in_Japan/file/60b7d5191fffa7aa6e.pdf">here</a>, <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10552-009-9311-5">here</a> and <a href="http://www.emfields.org/news/20111109-mobilewise-cellphones-children.asp">here</a>). Belgium just <a href="http://www.emfields.org/news/20130307-mobile-phones-children-banned-belgium.asp">banned</a> cell phones specifically designed for children up to age 7 based on this risk.<br /><br />Armed with this information, recommendations have been suggested for limiting a child’s exposure to pressing cell phones up to their skulls via hands-free devices or even using speakerphone options. WI-FI exposure in the house can be limited by opting to hard wire computers to modems and unplugging computers and modems at night or when not in use.<br /><br />In a pediatric nursing article “<a href="http://pediatricnursing.net/ce/2015/article39026570.pdf">Cell Phones and Children: Follow the Precautionary Road</a>” Suzanne Rosenberg wrote, <b>“While the government has deemed RF radiation to be safe, there is no current significant research to make this claim.”</b> Just like the abundance of chemicals in our food, there is a vested interest in keeping a lid on information regarding just how dangerous this continual radiation exposure could be.<br /><br />Cancer rates have risen to epidemic levels if estimates now show one in two adults will get cancer sometime in their lifetime. With childhood cancer as the number one child killer, what kind of cancer odds will our children face in their future?

For some, you are beginning to distrust the food supply and want to grow our own food. Or, perhaps, you live in an area prone to many types of disasters and have seen how desperate people become when their needs aren't met. Or, perhaps you grew up in a family in which self reliance and certain skill sets were ingrained into you at a young age. Wherever your path started, the end result is the same – to be self reliant.<br /><br /><b>Frustration is a Part of the Journey</b><br /><br />I’m going to be honest, when it comes to my own road towards self reliance, I get frustrated on a continual basis. My plan lately has been to increase my skills set and I’ve had some epic failures the past few months. The frustration has been enough to make me question myself and give up. But I know that I am my own worst enemy and those obstacles and mistakes are a part of the path that will help me in the long run.<br /><br />Sometimes I begin wondering if self reliance is a magical, unattainable myth. It’s such a simple concept but once you start on this path you realize how long the trek in front of you really is. After being on the self reliant road for five years, I am here to say that I still have a ways to go, but I’m enjoying the view along the way.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Courage and perseverance have a magical talisman, before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air. - John Quincy Adams</blockquote><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br /><b>Silence the Doubts</b><br /><ul><li><b>Don’t fear mistakes</b> - As a whole, we fear making mistakes.

Give up, and find an easier path, or, 2. Dig in and keep going. The glistening prize of self reliance is far too great for me to give up on. I made the choice to dig in and keep going and found some steps to help you reach this destination.<br /><br />Like all things, you have to start with a goal in mind and develop a plan around it. Self reliance is the end result where smaller goals must be met in order to achieve it. These smaller achievements also help move you forward.<br /><ol><li><b>Set a goal</b> – This may be to have enough supplies to live for 3 months, or 6 months or indefinitely. But set it and stick with it.</li><li><b>Plan a course of action</b> – Break your plan down into smaller plans. I have had a lot of success by breaking down my preparedness plans into short term needs and long term needs. Look into the <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/52-weeks-to-preparedness-an-introduction_19072011/">52 Weeks to Preparedness</a> to see how achievable these short term plans can be.</li><li><b>Prepare</b> – It’s time to prepare and know what to expect along the way. Here are <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/freedom-through-self-reliance_02022010/">four steps</a> you can take to get you moving toward self reliant living.</li><li><b>Take a step</b> - The path of self-reliance starts with only a single step and then another and another. Once we begin taking those first steps, we begin to see change and as a result, begin to adopt these new found changes and our lifestyle will transition into one that better supports our new way of life.</li><li><b>Don’t give up</b> – We all will fail from time to time – it’s just a part of the learning process. But if your goal is important to you, when you do fail – you’ll try again and again. We learn from these failures and become better through the learning curve.</li></ol>I've realized that in order to be successful at something we have to stay the course. To live a self reliant lifestyle takes time, effort and certain amount of sacrifice to get to the level of preparedness that we want. When doubt takes over, I look back and see how far I've come and simply take a step and keep going.<br /><br /><i>Contributed by Tess Pennington of <a href="http://www.readynutrition.com/">Ready Nutrition</a>.<br /><br />Tess Pennington is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Preppers-Cookbook-Nutritious-Life-Saving/dp/1612431291">The Prepper’s Cookbook: 300 Recipes to Turn Your Emergency Food into Nutritious, Delicious, Life-Saving Meals</a>.

The results of a new study indicate that our pleasure in consuming sweet solutions is driven to a great extent by the amount of energy it provides. The greatest rewards in the brain are attributed to sugars compared to artificial sweeteners which offer only short-term pleasure at a huge health cost.<br /><br /><b>Fooling The Body At The Expense of Appetite</b><br /><br />Using artificial sweeteners may actually throw off the body's ability to monitor how many calories we consume. Rats fed an artificially sweetened diet tend to overeat when given naturally sweetened high-calorie food compared with rats that had never consumed artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Researchers also found that the thickness of a sweetened drink seems to interfere with rats' abilities to keep their calorie consumption under control.<br /><div><br />"We propose that humans and other animals use sweetness and viscosity to help estimate the caloric content of the foods they eat, with sweeter and thicker foods signaling more calories and less sweet and thinner foods signaling fewer calories," said Dr. Terry L. Davidson of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br />Along with Purdue co-author Dr. Susan E. Swithers, Davidson hypothesized that consuming foods and beverages that are either low-calorie but very sweet or high-calorie but very thin may interfere with the ability to rely on taste and thickness to regulate caloric intake.<br /><br />Previous studies have shown that regular consumption of artificial, low-calorie <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?cx=008658674907507047567:ozcb-7cqbvu&amp;cof=LH%3A48;CX%3APreventDisease.com;FORID%3A1;S%3Ahttp%3A//www.preventdisease.com;L%3Ahttp%3A//www.preventdisease.com/images/PDlogo938.gif;LP%3A1&amp;q=%22artificial%2Bsweeteners%22&amp;hl=en&amp;client=pub-0663688274569192">sweeteners</a> may actually cause people to gain more weight than similar consumption of sugar. According to one study conducted by researchers from Purdue University and published in the journal Behavioral Neuroscience found that rats given saccharin actually gained more weight than the rats in the sugar group. <br /><br />"There's something about diet foods that changes your metabolic limit, your brain chemistry," said Dr. Marie Savard, medical contributor for ABC News.<br /><br /><b>Choose Low-Calorie Now At The Expense of High Calorie Later</b><br /><br />Professor Ivan de Araujo, who led a study at Yale University School of Medicine USA, says: “The consumption of high-calorie beverages is a major contributor to weight gain and obesity, even after the introduction of artificial sweeteners to the market. We believe that the discovery is important because it shows how physiological states may impact on our choices between sugars and sweeteners.<br /><br />“Specifically, it implies that humans frequently ingesting low-calorie sweet products in a state of hunger or exhaustion may be more likely to ‘relapse’ and choose high calorie alternatives in the future.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-09/w-tbc092013.php">The study</a> identified a specific physiological brain signal that is critical for determining choice between sugars and sweeteners. This signal regulates dopamine levels -- a chemical necessary for reward signalling in the brain -- and only arises when sugar is broken down into a form where it is usable as fuel for cells of the body to function.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/foodcrisis.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7PNZ-8rhbdA/TtEamOUoabI/AAAAAAAAM2k/-dEMOyPjP78/s200/300x250-2.jpg" /></a>Research was performed in mice, using a combination of behavioural testing involving sweeteners and sugars, whilst measuring chemical responses in brain circuits for reward. The researchers believe the findings are likely to reflect in humans.<br /><br />Professor de Araujo says: “According to the data, when we apply substances that interfere with a critical step of the ‘sugar-to-energy pathway’, the interest of the animals in consuming artificial sweetener decreases significantly, along with important reductions in brain dopamine levels.<br /><br />“This is verified by the fact that when hungry mice -- who thus have low sugar levels -- are given a choice between artificial sweeteners and sugars, they are more likely to completely switch their preferences towards sugars even if the artificial sweetener is much sweeter than the sugar solution.”<br /><br />Now that the team know that dopamine cells are critical in sugar/sweetener choice, they hope to identify the associated receptors and pathways in the brain. <br /><br /><b>Aspartame a Poison Unparalleled</b><br /><br /><a href="http://preventdisease.com/GoogleSearchResults.shtml?q=aspartame&amp;sa.x=0&amp;sa.y=0&amp;cx=partner-pub-0663688274569192%3Ae1bgloqgmc2&amp;cof=FORID%3A10&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;siteurl=preventdisease.com%252Findex.shtml">Aspartame</a> via ingestion into the digestive tract, is made into some ten other poisonings by the digestive processes, and then excepting that which is delivered directly to the pancreas, they are transported straight to the liver via the portal vein, where they then are very partially dealt with, and partially reprocessed.<br /><br />Artificial sweeteners are 200 times sweeter than regular sugar. In lab studies rats were more addicted to aspartame than cocaine.<br /><br />Former McGill University researcher Dana Small specializes in the neuropsychology of flavour and feeding at Yale University in New Haven, Conn. Small said there's mounting evidence that artificial sweeteners have a couple of problematic effects. Sugar substitutes such as <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2013/02/15/artificial-sweetners-diet-nutrition.html">sucralose and aspartame are more intensely sweet than sugar and may rewire taste receptors so less sweet, healthier foods aren't as enjoyable</a>, shifting preferences to higher calorie, sweeter foods, she said. Small and some other researchers believe artificial sweeteners interfere with brain chemistry and hormones that regulate appetite and satiety. For millennia, sweet taste signalled the arrival of calories. But that's no longer the case with artificial sweeteners.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/organicfood.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TW_lAOEOZEI/AAAAAAAAHRE/fDi5YhxdsQs/groworganic.jpg" /></a>"The sweet taste is no longer signalling energy and so the body adapts," Small said in an interview with CBC News. "It's no longer going to release insulin when it senses sweet because sweet now is not such a good predictor of the arrival of energy." The chemical change is the same reason why "when you brush your teeth and then drink orange juice, it tastes bad," said study co-author Christine Swoboda, a doctoral candidate in nutrition at Ohio State University.<br /><br />Diet soda causes dehydration, weight gain, mineral depletion, diabetes and caffeine addiction, research shows they're also responsible for an <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/12/020112_New-Research-Shows-Diet-Soft-Drinks-Cause-Stroke-Heart-Attack-and-Vascular-Death.shtml">increased risk of vascular events such as stroke, heart attack, and vascular death</a>. <br /><br />Artificially sweetened soft drinks are marketed as healthier alternatives to sugar-sweetened beverages, due to their lack of calories.

Time doesn't fill me. I fill time.</b><br /><br />The average person who is given two weeks to complete a task will instinctively adjust his or her effort so it actually takes two weeks. Average people allow time to impose its will on them; remarkable people impose their will on their time and allow fluidity. They don't stress about time and because their perception is more fluid, time does not become their focus and tasks become more manageable.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><b><br /></b><b>2. I understand balance.</b><br /><br />They know that the terms money and success are not interchangeable. They understand that people who are successful on a financial level only, are not successful at all. They have an off switch. They know how to relax, enjoy what they have in their life and to have fun. Their career is not their identity, it’s their job. It’s not who they are, it’s what they do. Unfortunately we live in a society which teaches that money equals success. Like many other things, money is a tool. It’s certainly not a bad thing but ultimately, it’s just another resource. Unfortunately, too many people worship it.<br /><br /><b>3. The people around me are the people I chose.</b><br /><br />Choose the people you want around you and don't let people you don't want around you choose you. If the people around you make you unhappy it's not their fault. It's your fault. They're in your professional or personal life because you drew them to you--and you let them remain. Kind people like to associate with kind people. It's about aligning yourself with like-minded people. They understand the importance of being part of a team. They create win-win relationships. A mean boss will only attract people he or she can control where a boss that empowers will attract people that love to be empowered. The former is a disempowering relationship while the latter is an empowering relationship. Know the difference.<br /><br /><b>4. I'm never bored and I never complain.</b><br /><br />Complainers, whiners and those who refuse to take complete responsibility for their actions and outcomes (or lack thereof) often meet their demise in this respect. They bore easily because they are too busy pretending life has to meet their expectations instead of them reaching out and being passionate about every experience. It's about being busy, productive and proactive. While most are laying on the couch, planning, over-thinking, sitting on their hands and generally going around in circles, effective people are out there getting the job done. When you are living the life you choose, complaining, whining and boredom don't exist.<br /><br /><b>5. I have never paid my dues.</b><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/miracle-mind.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qowGSTw02Pw/T2NvLdG4KVI/AAAAAAAAOrA/oAUJFUFAexw/s252/160x252.jpg" /></a><br />Dues aren't paid, past tense. Dues get paid, each and every day. The only real measure of your value is the tangible contribution you make on a daily basis. No job is ever too menial, no task ever too unskilled or boring. Remarkably effective people never feel entitled--except to the fruits of their labor.<br /><br /><b>6. I ask the right questions.</b><br /><br />They consciously and methodically create their own success by asking the questions that will make them more productive, creative, with a more positive mindset and empowering emotional state.<br /><br /><b>7. Failure is something I accomplish; it doesn't just happen to me.</b><br /><br />Occasionally something completely outside your control will cause you to fail. Most of the time though, it's you. And that's okay. Every successful person has failed. Numerous times. Most of them have failed a lot more often than you. But they found lessons in failures, not problems or misery. That's why they learned how to be effective. Embrace every failure: Own it, learn from it, and take full responsibility for making sure that next time, things will turn out differently.<br /><br /><b>8. Clarity, innovation and focus.</b><br /><br /><b>T</b>hey have clarity and certainty about what they want (and don’t want) for their life. They actually visualize and plan their best reality while others are merely spectators of life. They innovate rather than imitate. They don’t procrastinate and they don’t spend their life waiting for the ‘right time’. The focus and apply themselves.<br /><br /><b>9. Volunteers always win.</b><br /><br />Whenever you raise your hand you wind up being asked to do more. That's great. Doing more is an opportunity: to learn, to impress, to gain skills, to build new relationships -- to do something more than you would otherwise been able to do. Success is based on action. The more you volunteer, the more you get to act. Effective people step forward to create opportunities. Remarkably effective people sprint forward. They look for and find opportunities where others see nothing.<br /><br /><b>10. Not only good communicators, but the best communicators</b><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/unexplainablefrequencies.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IxbGiBSsnzg/UDUKGoSAGMI/AAAAAAAARfM/QsLujOF3pGM/s200/aa200block.gif" /></a><br />They are good communicators and they consciously work at it. They are more effective than most at managing their emotions when communicating with others and they are not slaves to these emotions. Ego does not rule their lives. They have identified their core values (what is important to them) and they do their best to live a life which is reflective of those values when speaking with others. Their ethical behavior is sound.<br /><br /><b>11. I address the solutions, not the problems.</b><br /><br />People have a tendency of creating more problems than solutions which hinders their effectiveness. They can only see obstacles where as others just have a way of seeing past them and getting right to the solutions that no longer make a problem....well, a problem anymore. They are solutions seekers, not problem enablers.<br /><br /><b>12. I am humble and happy to admit my own mistakes.</b><br /><br />They apologize when they must. They forgive and they are confident in their ability, but not arrogant. They are happy to learn from others and see other perspectives than their own. They are happy to make others look good rather than seek their own personal glory.<br /><br /><b>13. I set higher standards for myself.</b><br /><br />This in turn produces greater commitment, more momentum, a better work ethic and of course, better results. They don’t rationalize failure. While many are talking about their age, their sore back, their lack of time, their poor genetics, their ‘bad luck’, their nasty boss and their lack of opportunities (all good reasons to fail), they are finding a way to succeed despite all their challenges.<br /><br /><b>14. I finish what I start.</b><br /><br />While so many spend their life starting things that they never finish, effective people get the job done even when the excitement and the novelty have worn off. Even when it ain’t fun.<br /><br /><b>15. Being multi-dimensional, amazing, and wonderfully complex</b><br /><br />They realize that not only are they physical and psychological beings, but emotional and spiritual creatures as well. They consciously work at being healthy and productive on all levels inside and out. They don’t hang out with toxic people and they don’t invest time or emotional energy into things which they have no control of. They do what they can do advance themselves to the best of their ability and never look back, even for a second, because the past is no longer within their control. They plan for the future in harmony with their present state of mind and don't overplan or overanalyze because they understand that thought processes are constantly evolving and forever growing.<br /><br /><i><a href="http://preventdisease.com/">Tara Laserna</a> is a Reiki master, energy healer, meditation and wellness coach.</i><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Even among those who smoked, the garlic consumption reduced lung cancer risk by 30%. The study was published in the journal <i><a href="http://cancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org/content/6/7/711.abstract">Cancer Prevention Research</a></i>.<br /><br />Researchers believe that the benefits of raw garlic may be linked to a chemical called allicin, which is released once the garlic is either smashed or diced. This chemical is rumoured to not only reduce inflammation but also decrease the damage from free radicals to the body’s cells. The study used  the data of approximately 4,500 lung cancer patients and 4,500 healthy adults from 2003 to 2010. If you are looking to provide your body with a healthier environment, this is just one of the many health benefits raw garlic can provide you with. It’s time for human beings to make a change, and one of those changes includes the way we eat.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br />Cancer incidence rates continue to rise every year, according to the American Cancer Society. Males have approximately a 1 in 2 chance of developing cancer within their lifetime, and a 1 in 4 chance of dying from it. Women have a 1 in 3 chance of developing it and a 1 in 5 risk of dying from it.  We continue to search for a cure, while we forget to acknowledge the cause. We choose to surround ourselves with a bombardment of chemicals, GMOs, artificial sweeteners, harmful cosmetics, hazardous household products and more. Is it really a mystery that cancer rates continue to increase? Our eating habits as a whole tend to be extremely poor and we continue to ignore the amount of research that can render cancer lifeless.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oBYhzykle4E/UF4PWSOj_EI/AAAAAAAARz8/IxYhUqLJB9M/s220/200.jpg" /></a>For example, <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/08/23/20-medical-studies-that-prove-cannabis-can-cure-cancer/">here</a> is a list of 20 medical studies that prove cannabis can be an effective treatment, and possible cure for cancer. <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/06/26/dichloroacetate-university-of-alberta-doctors-discover-a-cure-for-cancer/">Here</a>, doctors at the University of Alberta discovered a cure for cancer, a substance that dramatically reduced tumors that has never seen proper attention from the medical industry due to its inability to generate a profit. The list goes on and on. The information shared in the video below is also something to ponder when thinking about both cancer and cancer cures. I am definitely open to the idea that certain cures are suppressed, and Kimberly Carter Gamble makes a good point in the video on that exact idea. At the end of the day it all comes down to making better choices in your life.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="320" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/aWRzikJ3iso?feature=player_embedded" width="600"></iframe><br /><br />This article is not meant to spread fear. In my opinion, cancer is easily preventable, treatable and can indeed be cured. I am just trying to bring awareness here about the tidbits of info that might help you in your quest to live a more healthy life. Your body houses your soul, it’s always best to keep it free from ailments and toxins so you can hear your inner voice with more clarity. A healthy body contributes to feeling much better, and the way you feel is directly related to what type of experience you create for yourself and those around you.<br /><br /><b>RELATED NATURAL BLAZE ARTICLE:</b><br /><a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/2013/04/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-garlic.html"><b><span style="font-size: large;">10 Amazing Health Benefits Of Garlic</span></b></a><br /><b><br /></b> <b>Sources:</b><br /><br /><a href="http://digitaljournal.com/article/356155">http://digitaljournal.com/article/356155</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancerbasics/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer">http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancerbasics/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer</a><br /><br /><a href="http://life.nationalpost.com/2013/08/06/eating-raw-garlic-twice-a-week-may-reduce-lung-cancer-risk-study-says/">http://life.nationalpost.com/2013/08/06/eating-raw-garlic-twice-a-week-may-reduce-lung-cancer-risk-study-says/</a><br /><br /><a href="http://cancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org/content/6/7/711.abstract">http://cancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org/content/6/7/711.abstract</a><br /><br /><br /><i><a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/author/arjun/">Arjun Walia</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;I've been researching into many of the topics I write about for several years, a few of my interests stem from childhood.

/* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br /><b>1.       Benefits in pregnancy</b>.  Avocados are a natural source of folate which contains folic acid and is important for the development of a healthy fetus.  Synthetic versions of folic acid are recommended for all women who are planning to get pregnant; eating avocados is a simpler and tastier option!<br /><br /><b>2.       Avocados are brimming with ‘good’ fats</b>.  You may have heard that you should avoid avocados due to their high fat content.  This is not quite the case.  While they are very high in fat (and calories) these are monounsaturated fats or ‘good fats’.  They assist good heart health and help to lower blood pressure.  The monounsaturated fats found in avocados can also help to reverse insulin resistance which can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes.  <br /><br /><b>3.       Fantastic source of Vitamin E</b>.  Avocados are the fruit with the highest level of Vitamin E (yes avocados are a fruit!)  Vitamin E is an essential vitamin and helps to maintain overall health.  Vitamin E also has positive effects on heart disease, stroke, cancer prevention, and development of cataracts and is widely claimed to have anti-aging properties.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3r6MC2eTURY/UF4PWCetL1I/AAAAAAAARz0/qsSSnRnWLNQ/s220/200-2.jpg" /></a><b>4.       Source of dietary fiber</b>.  Avocados contain both soluble and insoluble fiber meaning they help to reduce cholesterol levels by preventing re-absorption, help to maintain bowel function and can assist the body to avoid blood sugar spikes after meals.<br /><br /><b>5.       You know exactly what you’re getting when you buy an avocado</b>.  At the time of writing there are no genetically modified avocado crops.  Avocados have such a thick skin that the inner fruit is protected from pesticides making the cost of organic avocados something you can easily bypass.<br /><br /><b>6.       Avocados are a ‘brain food’</b>.  Dr. Daniel G. Amen considers them one of the best brain-healthy foods that you can consume to help reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's.   Omega 3 fatty acids as well as Vitamin E are naturally occurring in avocados and have been clinically proven to stop Alzheimer's disease from progressing and possibly even reversing the very early stages.<br /><br /><b>7.       Better nutrient absorption</b>.  Adding avocado to a meal has been found to increase the amount of carotenoids absorbed from that meal by up to 5 times.  Carotenoids include beta carotene and lycopene which are important nutrients for good health.  This increase is through to be due to nutrients and enzymes in avocados that reduce stomach inflammation and inflammation in the small intestine’s mucous lining.  So you not only get the powerhouse of nutrients contained in the avocado but you get greater benefits from the foods you choose to eat with it.<br /><br /><b>8.       May aid in stroke prevention</b>.  The high folate levels that are beneficial to pregnant women may also play a part in reducing the incidence of stroke.  Those who eat diets that contain a lot of folate have been shown to suffer stroke far less than those who eat less folate in their everyday diet. <br /><br /><b>9.       Reduction of cholesterol</b>.  One study has shown a 17% decrease in cholesterol levels for participants who ate increased amounts of avocado for just one week.  Researchers believe this is due to beta-sitosterol which has previously been found to assist in lowering cholesterol levels.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/noglasses.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EhUmYzZq0ck/UHMzRkl5t4I/AAAAAAAAAMY/L0KVT0wOslc/s160/ad1%25283%2529.jpg" /></a><b>10.   Protection for your eyes</b>.  Eating avocados can increase your levels of Lutein which protects against macular degeneration and the formation of cataracts.  Further research is needed to determine exactly what it is that may assist in eye protection.<br /><br />Adding an avocado into your daily diet and reaping the above benefits is so easy.  Avocado is great added to salads, made into guacamole and even eaten alone with ground pepper and a few drops of olive oil.  It can also easily be substituted for fats in cooking and baking.  Take out the oil or butter and replace it with the same amount of avocado.  You’ll add interesting flavors to your cooking and will be helping your overall health.<br /><br />Avocados are extremely tasty and are chock full of nutritional goodness.  <br /><br />Try one today! <br /><br /><b>Sources</b>:<br /><a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/040067_avocado_cancer_prevention_superfood.html">http://www.naturalnews.com/040067_avocado_cancer_prevention_superfood.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.healthdiaries.com/eatthis/10-health-benefits-of-avocados.html">http://www.healthdiaries.com/eatthis/10-health-benefits-of-avocados.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-09/fl-nro091813.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-09/fl-nro091813.php</a><br /><a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/01/17/avocado-benefits.aspx">http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/01/17/avocado-benefits.aspx</a><br /><a href="http://www.avocado.org.au/nutrition/nutritional_information.aspx">http://www.avocado.org.au/nutrition/nutritional_information.aspx</a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/primalburn.html" rel="nofollow" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oQkqKt8f0ME/UCU9nJvDpLI/AAAAAAAARVg/IaufidyG9n8/s468/468_option6.jpg" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"http://www.naturalblaze.com/2013/09/10-health-benefits-of-avocados.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"noreply@blogger.com (Activist)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2013-09-22T09:08:30.393-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:106:"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_vyjebFr7Qk/Uj8VX1qy9AI/AAAAAAAATuo/BI0dE1UtpqQ/s72-c/674px-Avocado_IMGP1082.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4446947302163364668.post-7289941497125671634";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 22 Sep 2013 15:59:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Dave Mihalovic";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"vaccine-information";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18:"forced vaccination";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"lawsuit";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"Child Kicked Out of School For Not Vaccinating Despite Doctor&#039;s Advice That Vaccines Could Kill Her";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12952:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ru1tZRDLWO8/Uj8THI40J3I/AAAAAAAAAmE/xlA49m3Kq3s/s1600/mary-ckeck2-300x225+(1).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ru1tZRDLWO8/Uj8THI40J3I/AAAAAAAAAmE/xlA49m3Kq3s/s1600/mary-ckeck2-300x225+(1).jpg" /></a></div><div>By Dave Mihalovic</div><div><br /></div>A New York State school has terminated the rights of a child to attend classes solely on the basis of being unvaccinated. This despite the advice of her Physician who stated that it could kill her. A devout Catholic mom has now filed a lawsuit against the State government. Read her story:<br /><br />Mary is almost six and a half years old, and she enjoys going to school, dancing, singing, swimming, and playing with her sister and friends. Today I looked at her beautiful face smiling while she was playing with her dolls, and I can’t believe how far we have come since the day she was born and how blessed I am to call her mine. At first glance, you wouldn’t know the battles that she has been through.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br />When Mary was born I didn’t know what ingredients were put into vaccinations, just like most parents. I was brainwashed into thinking that I must vaccinate my child since this is what U.S. social norms say that we as parents are supposed to do for our children. So Mary was vaccinated like every other typical newborn in this country. After each vaccination, she would have a negative reaction. At that point, the medical professionals did not know what was wrong with her, but looking back now we know that it was two DTaP vaccines that she received on July 9th, 2007 and August 13th, 2007.<br /><br />She ended up being completely overwhelmed with thrush and intestinal yeast toxins after it had nowhere else to go in her tiny, little less-than-five-pound body. Mucus was leaking out of her eyes, vagina, and her rear end was red like it was put over a flame of fire. My daughter was not absorbing her nutrients, and she wasn’t growing. On the way home from a vaccination appointment, when she received her Comvax immunizations on August 29th, 2007, Mary was crying and nothing would console her. Her same symptoms came back that she experienced from her DTaP vaccinations. The combination of yeast and negative organisms ended up causing a double ear infection as well.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8n0lSATEOvA/UHClnvZ78iI/AAAAAAAAAI4/_hdaYp5kbtA/s250/legal-vaccine.jpg" style="background-image: none; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: none;" /></a> The doctor had prescribed her a compounded suppository antibiotic because that is the protocol for healing an ear infection in NY State, but, in Mary’s case, it was a disaster and caused more damage to her immune system -- just like every other unnatural substance that was given to her. We administered the medicine to her at home as instructed, but less than twenty seconds later Mary went into anaphylactic shock. She started vomiting, convulsing, water was pouring out of her rectum, and her eyes rolled into the back of her head. Everything was happening so quickly, I couldn’t reach the phone to call 911. My first reaction was to cry out to the Lord, “In the name of Jesus, save my baby!” All of a sudden, the vomiting stopped and the color came back into her face. Her eyes were looking at us, she was breathing normally and a peace and calmness came over her. The only one who could save us and rescue Mary so swiftly during that crisis was Our Heavenly Father, and that is just one of the many miracles that my family has experienced through the Lord, Jesus <a href="http://thinkingmomsrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mary-check.jpg"></a>Christ.<br /><br />After years of testing and treating her, we now know that she has an overactive immune system. Due to Mary’s overactive immune system, she cannot tolerate any preservatives or artificial ingredients. Mary has a severe gluten sensitivity and is allergic to casein, etc. She is on an all-natural diet, and on a strict regimen to help support and strengthen her gastrointestinal tract and immune system. Dyes, preservatives, and unnatural substances all make her violently sick. She is brave and remains strong through her struggles because of her faith in God and the positive people that are put in our path. We are all very proud of her.<br /><br />In 2010 we applied for a religious exemption from vaccinations and were guaranteed by the director of the school that everything was set and she would be able to attend school because of her religious exemption. In 2012, Mary’s health took a turn for the worse and, after being hospitalized, our family doctor told me that Mary qualified for a medical exemption. He said that vaccination would compromise her immune system and stated that “It is my medical opinion that Mary Check cannot tolerate any insults, in even the slightest amounts, to her immune system without putting her at risk for anaphalaxis, which include, vaccines, medications, and certain foods.” Still with the religious exemption in place, I didn’t think it was necessary to apply for a medical exemption as well, just yet, since I was told that the religious exemption was acceptable. When Mary entered kindergarten, I spoke with the principal of the elementary school and told her about my medical and religious exemptions, so she could get to know Mary’s situation. I told the principal that I would be using Mary’s religious exemption, but I also gave her my medical exemption application to put on file as well, because I was new to the public school system and didn’t know what they needed. I trusted the school system and they failed me. In October, that medical exemption application that I did not want to be filed was mysteriously handed into the Board of Health. In fact, I did not even apply for a medical exemption. The medical exemption application resulted from a clerical error. I was told that I would be able to proceed with a religious exemption, but, when I went to the school to address the situation, it was too late.<br /><br />I was denied within 24 hours of application. Even though this medical exemption was not meant to go through at this point in time, Mary was denied her medical rights and she was kicked out of school. I was accused of trying to skirt around my denied medical exemption by applying for a religious exemption; the fact that I applied for a religious exemption in 2010 was completely ignored. I had to go to federal court to prove that my religious exemption was legitimate and to sue the Board of Education. My daughter’s medical issues are what made me pick up my Bible and read it every day and drew me closer to my beliefs that God made the body perfect and pure, and I don’t want to put any impurities into her body based on my deepest truths, which comes from the word of the Lord.<br /><br />While I believe that doctors are here to help heal the sick and I value their place on this earth, I do not have blind faith in medical professionals. They are human beings, and we are told by the Lord that we are not to put our complete faith in anyone else but Him. I respect my pediatrician’s advice, but, ultimately, I have to base my informed decisions on my own research, my faith, and my instincts as a parent. I get a diagnosis from the doctor and it does not go ignored. We work together on treating Mary to suit her needs. I have researched what poisons are put into these vaccinations, and I do not believe that it is God’s will to put them into our bodies. Immunizations contain unnatural substances that are injected into the bloodstream.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200" /></a>Winning this case will set new case law, but I am completely financially depleted in my battle, and I need your help in this fight for freedom. Mary represents the many children in the United States in need of legal representation to protect their health and safety. In supporting Mary’s choice, you are supporting parents’ and doctors’ rights to choose what is in the best interest of their children and patients. Whether or not you are pro-vaccination or pro-vaccination choice, this cause deals with the right of a parent to choose or refuse what vaccinations are given to their children. All parents should have the right to choose what kind of medical treatment their children should receive, and, if a person has religious beliefs contrary to a medical treatment, our constitutional right to the free exercise of religion should be protected and not subject to the review of one person, as it is in the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.<br /><br />What touched me so close to my heart is when Barbara Loe Fisher, president of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) said, “We as parents, who know and love our children better than anyone else, we by U.S. law and a larger moral imperative, are the guardians of our children until they are old enough to make life and death decisions for themselves. We are responsible for their welfare, and we are the ones who bear the grief and the burden when they are injured or die from any cause. We are their voice and, by all that is right in this great country and in the moral universe, we should be allowed to make a rational, informed, voluntary decision about which diseases and which vaccines we are willing to risk their lives for without fearing retribution from employees of the state.” Argue with us. Educate us. Persuade us. But don’t track us down and force us to violate our moral conscience and beliefs, or criticize our doctors’ professional opinion in the medical approach they choose to take, putting the best interest of their patients first.<br /><br />On October 10th, 2013 Support Mary’s Rights will be hosting a fundraising dinner and dance at Li Greci’s Staaten to help not only raise money to support the Mary’s legal efforts in her fight against the New York Board of Education and the Supreme Court but also to raise awareness about the vaccinations parents and doctors are forced to give to their children and patients, regardless of the ingredients or harmful affects they may cause.<br /><br />Support Mary’s Rights would appreciate your charitable contribution. A monetary donation or donated gift certificates or items to raffle off would truly help this very unique and special cause. I need my voice to be heard for myself and other families who are suffering from similar experiences where the government is trying to tell us what we mandatorily have to put into our bodies. Our faith as parents leads us to take physical, spiritual, and mental responsibility and make decision for the health and well being of our children. The government is trying to take away these rights as parents. Come to our fundraiser and share your stories with us. We would love to hear them and to support you as well!

Now a microbiologist from the Kansas State University has discovered a herbal medicine can be used as a breakthrough treatment.<br /><br />Assistant professor of biology at Kansas State University, Mr Govindsamy Vediyappan, noted that developing nations regularly used Gymnema Slyvestre (a medical herb) to control sugar levels in diabetics.  When he studied the microbiological possibilities of this herb, he discovered it could be used to treat a very common fungal pathogen found in humans called Candida albicans.<br /><br />Candida albicans lives in both intestinal and oral areas as a normal flora would.  The problems begin when the fungus overgrows, as this can be the start of genital, intestinal and oral infections.  Shockingly, nearly 30% of people will die from this fungus once they have it.  This is particularly a concern for people with reduced immune systems like those suffering from HIV and cancer, and people who have had organ transplants.<br /><br />There are two different forms of the fungus.  The first is a very treatable yeast infection.  The second is a hyphal form which is very hard to treat.  When the fungus moves from a yeast infection to the hyphal stage of growth, the difficulty with treatment is due to filament-like combinations of cells which can more easily spread into the different organs of the body.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br />Vediyappan stated "Once it gets into the tissue, it spreads like roots and is difficult to contain by our immune system."<br /><br />The main point of the studies conducted by the research team was to test if the Gymnema Slyvestre herb could be used to block the hyphal growth stage of Candida albicans.  <br /><br />Gymnema Slyvestre is found in Australia, China and India and is a plant which grows as a tropical vine.  The leaves of the vine, which contain gymnemic acids, are already widely accepted as a traditional medicinal plant.  As a cost effective treatment, the extract is regularly used to treat many ailments, including diabetes.  It can be taken as a drink form to aid in weight loss and to help in the control of sugar levels in the body.<br /><br />The research team, led by Vediyappan, purified compounds of gymnemic acid and discovered that these compounds could prevent the stage where the yeast transitioned into the hyphal stage.  This stopped the spread of the fungus and kept it in a form that is more easily managed.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N2GOFRKd8Vs/UF4PWWZ5dsI/AAAAAAAARz4/tuwcrewmlWA/s316/herbalcures.png" style="background-image: none; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: none;" width="160" /></a>This was a successful investigation for two reasons.<br /><ol><li>The team found the compounds in the gymnemic acid were nontoxic.  This is particularly important for human health as cancer patients and those with compromised immune systems are likely to benefit from treatments which do not harm their cells.</li><li>The researchers also discovered that the gymnemic acid was capable of blocking the virulence properties contained in the fungus.  Being able to block the transition from fungus to hyphal growth makes the fungus more easily treated.  Potential new drugs could be developed using the findings of Vediyappan and his team of researchers.  "We have shown that this compound is safe to use because it doesn't hurt our body cells, yet it blocks the virulence of this fungus under in vitro conditions.”</li></ol>During the research period it was discovered that the compounds were quick to work on the fungal infection, making the discoveries very important.  It has been found that within thirty minutes of an infection forming, the treatable fungal yeast infection can turn into the hyphal growth phase.  One this change has occurred, branched filaments will form and the spread to other organs of the body can commence.<br /><br />Candida albicans in a fungal form makes a biofilm which is difficult to clear up.  The studies by these researchers found that the compounds in the gymnemic acid actually converted this biofilm back to a treatable yeast form and Vediyappan points out the importance of this.  "This compound prevents the biofilm formation because hyphae are the major builders of biofilms and biofilms are resistant to antifungals," Vediyappan said. "Yeast cells by themselves cannot make biofilms and are sensitive to antifungal treatments."<br /><br />The original research can be found in the<i> PLOS ONE</i> journal.  The article is titled "Gymnemic acids inhibit hyphal growth and virulence in Candida albicans."<br /><br />Govindsamy Vediyappan intends to further research potentials for the development of new drugs, further application in the treatment of diabetes and several other treatments for Candida albicans.  Other fungal pathogens such as Aspergillus were found to have their growth stopped by gymnemic acid during this initial research and there is the potential to discover improvements for the treatment of leukemia patients and also heart transplant recipients.<br /><br />Though this research team was not the first to realize the benefits of gymnemic acid compounds, they were definitely the first to discover the important ability to block the fungal transition properties of Candida albicans.<br /><div><br /></div><div><i><a href="http://www.phytoextracts.net/gymnema-sylvestre-leaf-dry-extract-762055.html">image source</a></i><br /><i><br /></i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/stepoutsidethebox.html" rel="nofollow" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-p1gLc-AkG_s/Tvi9JyyN1YI/AAAAAAAANjs/KmObDvyAPxo/s468/banner.gif" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://www.naturalblaze.com/2013/09/candida-albicans-possible-breakthrough.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"noreply@blogger.com (Activist)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2013-09-21T12:19:51.848-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:118:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eFxVLK9yEd0/Uj3wTkkcN6I/AAAAAAAATt4/y_Qagr7vnfY/s72-c/Gymnema-Sylvestre-Leaf-Dry-Extract.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4446947302163364668.post-6321012831953998085";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 15:55:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"video";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"health-and-wellness";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Joe-Martino";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"natural-health-blog";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"Scientists Discover One Of The Greatest Contributing Factors To Happiness";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3754:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ITae6lnpP7Q/Ujxvy216iRI/AAAAAAAATro/i_ZVp1nuxeo/s1600/Gratitude.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="271" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ITae6lnpP7Q/Ujxvy216iRI/AAAAAAAATro/i_ZVp1nuxeo/s320/Gratitude.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>by Joe Martino<br /><br />We all want joy in our lives right? It sure beats feeling down doesn’t it? A scientific study looking thankfulness and gratitude revealed that both are key factors to happiness and they are very often forgotten about when considering the feeling of joy.<br /><br />In fact, people who share gratitude on a regular basis experience a greater amount of happiness in their lives. Perhaps it is because we tap into our own internal love when we share gratitude and in turn that affects our overall state - or maybe it is the union that is created when you express gratitude to someone.<br /><br />Either way, it is clear that gratitude is key to experiencing joy in your life. Having a down day? Thank someone for something and see how it makes you feel - it can’t hurt to try. Check out the powerful video below for some examples.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Gratitude is the “forgotten factor” in happiness research. &nbsp;We are engaged in a long-term research project designed to create and disseminate a large body of novel scientific data on the nature of gratitude, its causes, and its potential consequences for human health and well-being. Scientists are latecomers to the concept of gratitude. &nbsp;Religions and philosophies have long embraced gratitude as an indispensable manifestation of virtue, and an integral component of health, wholeness, and well-being. &nbsp;Through conducting highly focused, cutting-edge studies on the nature of gratitude, its causes, and its consequences, we hope to shed important scientific light on this important concept. &nbsp;This document is intended to provide a brief, introductory overview of the major findings to date of the research project. &nbsp;For further information, please contact either of the project investigators. - Robert A.

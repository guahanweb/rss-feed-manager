<p><span style="font-size:large;">September 28, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Whether or not these three men committed the crimes they&#8217;ve been accused of, there is no doubt scenarios have been written and established to emphasize and advertise them as mental cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And not only mental cases, but people “in need of psychiatric treatment&#8230;if we had only caught them in time, we could have gotten them help and then they wouldn&#8217;t have killed all those people&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">That&#8217;s the PR people at work, because <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2013/01/14/what-government-fears-most-blacks-and-whites-united-with-guns/" target="_blank">gun control</a></span></span> is only one of the items on the agenda here. The twin is MORE PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT AND DRUGGING.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And of course the way the story is being spun, anyone can go off the rails, so be on the alert, your neighbor could have a mental disorder, it&#8217;s all right, no stigma attached, he needs treatment right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/breaking-new-york-creates-psychiatric-police-state/" target="_blank">It’s called The Psychiatric State</a></span></span>. It&#8217;s based on myths and fairy tales about distinct and separate disorders and “good treatment” and sharing and caring in this new humane society of ours.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Everyone at some time in their lives will experience a mental disorder.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">An open secret has been slowly bleeding out into public consciousness for the past ten years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2012/08/09/mental-disorders-do-not-exist/" target="_blank">THERE ARE NO DEFINITIVE LABORATORY TESTS FOR ANY SO-CALLED MENTAL DISORDER</a></span></span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And along with that:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">ALL SO-CALLED MENTAL DISORDERS ARE CONCOCTED, NAMED, LABELED, DESCRIBED, AND CATEGORIZED by a committee of psychiatrists, from menus of human behaviors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Their findings are published in periodically updated editions of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), printed by the American Psychiatric Association (<span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="https://twitter.com/APAPsychiatric" target="_blank">twitter</a></span></span>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">For years, even psychiatrists have been blowing the whistle on this hazy crazy process of “research.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Of course, pharmaceutical companies, who manufacture highly toxic drugs to treat every one of these “disorders,” are leading the charge to invent more and more mental-health categories, so they can sell more drugs and make more money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But we have a mind-boggling twist. Under the radar, one of the great psychiatric stars, who has been out in front inventing mental disorders, went public. He blew the whistle on himself and his colleagues. And for 3 years, almost no one noticed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">His name is Dr. Allen Frances (<span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="https://twitter.com/AllenFrancesMD" target="_blank">twitter</a></span></span>), and he made VERY interesting statements to Gary Greenberg, author of a Wired article: <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/12/ff_dsmv/all/1" target="_blank"><i>“Inside the Battle to Define Mental Illness,”</i></a></span></span> (Dec.27, 2010).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Major media never picked up on the interview in any serious way. It never became a scandal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Dr. Allen Frances is the man who, in 1994, headed up the project to write the (then) latest edition of the psychiatric bible, the DSM-IV. This tome defines and labels and describes every official mental disorder. The DSM-IV eventually listed 297 of them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In an April 19, 1994, New York Times piece, <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/19/science/scientist-at-work-allen-j-frances-revamping-psychiatrists-bible.html" target="_blank"><i>“Scientist At Work,”</i></a></span></span> Daniel Goleman called Frances “Perhaps the most powerful psychiatrist in America at the moment&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Well, sure. If you&#8217;re sculpting the entire canon of diagnosable mental disorders for your colleagues, for insurers, for the government, for Pharma (who will sell the drugs matched up to the 297 DSM-IV diagnoses), you&#8217;re right up there in the pantheon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Long after the DSM-IV had been put into print, Dr. Frances talked to Wired&#8217;s Greenberg and said the following:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><i>“There is no definition of a mental disorder. It&#8217;s bullshit. I mean, you just can&#8217;t define it.”</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">BANG.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">That&#8217;s on the order of the designer of the Hindenburg, looking at the burned rubble on the ground, remarking, “Well, I knew there would be a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">After a suitable pause, Dr. Frances remarked to Greenberg, “These concepts [of distinct mental disorders] are virtually impossible to define precisely with bright lines at the borders.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Frances might have been referring to the fact that his baby, the DSM-IV, had rearranged earlier definitions of ADHD and Bipolar to permit many MORE diagnoses, leading to a vast acceleration of drug-dosing with highly powerful and toxic compounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Finally, at the end of the Wired interview, Frances flew off into a bizarre fantasy: </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Diagnosis [as spelled out in the DSM-IV] is part of the magic&#8230;you know those medieval maps? In the places where they didn&#8217;t know what was going on, they wrote &#8216;Dragons live here&#8217;&#8230;we have a dragon&#8217;s world here. But you wouldn&#8217;t want to be without the map.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Translation: Patients need hope for the healing of their troubles; so even if we psychiatrists are shooting blanks and pretending to know one kind of mental disorder from another, even if we&#8217;re inventing these mental-disorder definitions based on no biological or chemical diagnostic tests&#8212;it&#8217;s a good thing, because patients will then believe and have hope; they&#8217;ll believe it because psychiatrists place a </span><span style="font-size:large;"><i>name</i></span><span style="font-size:large;"> on their problems&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Needless to say, this has nothing to do with science.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If I were an editor at one of the big national newspapers, and one of my reporters walked in and told me, “The most powerful psychiatrist in America just said the DSM is sheer b.s.,” I think I&#8217;d make room on the front page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If the reporter then added, “This shrink was in charge of </span><span style="font-size:large;"><i>creating</i></span><span style="font-size:large;"> the DSM-IV,” I&#8217;d clear room above the fold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If the reporter went on to explain that the whole profession of psychiatry would collapse overnight if the DSM was discredited, I&#8217;d call for a special section of the paper to be printed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;d tell the reporter to get ready to pound on this story day after day for months. I&#8217;d tell him to track down all the implications of Dr. Frances&#8217; statements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;d open a bottle of champagne to toast the soon-to-be-soaring sales of my newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And then, of course, the next day I&#8217;d be fired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Because there are powerful multi-billion-dollar interests at stake, and those people don&#8217;t like their deepest secrets exposed in the press. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2013/09/27/if-an-elite-television-anchor-confessed-to-everything/" target="_blank">And as I walked out of my job</i></a></span></span>, I&#8217;d see a bevy of blank-eyed pharmaceutical executives marching into the office of the paper&#8217;s publisher, ready to read the riot act to him.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Dr. Frances&#8217; work on the DSM-IV allowed for MORE toxic drugs to be prescribed, because the definition of Bipolar was expanded to include more people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Adverse effects of Valproate (given for a Bipolar diagnosis) include: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><b>acute, life-threatening, and even fatal liver toxicity;</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><b>life-threatening inflammation of the pancreas;</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><b>brain damage.</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Adverse effects of Lithium (also given for a Bipolar diagnosis) include</span><span style="font-size:large;"><b>:</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><b>intercranial pressure leading to blindness;</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><b>peripheral circulatory collapse;</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><b>stupor and coma.</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Adverse effects of Risperdal (given for “Bipolar” and “irritability stemming from autism”) include:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><b>serious impairment of cognitive function;</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><b>fainting;</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><b>restless muscles in neck or face, tremors (may be indicative of motor brain damage).</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Dr. Frances&#8217; label-juggling act also permitted the definition of ADHD to expand, thereby opening the door for greater and greater use of toxic Ritalin (and other similar compounds) as the treatment of choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">So what about Ritalin? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In 1986, The International Journal of the Addictions published a most important literature review by Richard Scarnati. It was called “An Outline of Hazardous Side Effects of Ritalin (Methylphenidate)” [v.21(7), pp. 837-841].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Scarnati listed a large number of adverse affects of Ritalin and cited published journal articles which reported each of these symptoms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">For every one of the following (selected and quoted verbatim) Ritalin effects, there is at least one confirming source in the medical literature:</span></p>
<p>* Paranoid delusions<br />
* Paranoid psychosis<br />
* Hypomanic and manic symptoms, amphetamine-like psychosis<br />
* Activation of psychotic symptoms<br />
* Toxic psychosis<br />
* Visual hallucinations<br />
* Auditory hallucinations<br />
* Can surpass LSD in producing bizarre experiences<br />
* Effects pathological thought processes<br />
* Extreme withdrawal<br />
* Terrified affect<br />
* Started screaming<br />
* Aggressiveness<br />
* Insomnia<br />
* Since Ritalin is considered an amphetamine-type drug, expect amphetamine-like effects<br />
* Psychic dependence<br />
* High-abuse potential DEA Schedule II Drug<br />
* Decreased REM sleep<br />
* When used with antidepressants one may see dangerous reactions including hypertension, seizures and hypothermia<br />
* Convulsions<br />
* Brain damage may be seen with amphetamine abuse.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">A recent survey revealed that a high percentage of children diagnosed with bipolar had first received a diagnosis of ADHD. This is informative, because Ritalin and other speed-type drugs are given to kids who are slapped with the ADHD label. Speed, sooner or later, produces a crash. This is easy to call “clinical depression.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Then comes Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft. </span><span style="font-size:large;"><i>These</i></span><span style="font-size:large;"> drugs can produce temporary highs, followed by more crashes. The psychiatrist notices the up and down pattern&#8212;and then produces a new diagnosis of Bipolar (manic-depression) and prescribes other drugs, including Valproate and Lithium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In the US alone, there are at least 300,000 cases of motor brain damage incurred by people who have been prescribed so-called anti-psychotic drugs (aka “major tranquilizers”). Risperdal (mentioned above as a drug given to people diagnosed with Bipolar) is one of those major tranquilizers. (source: <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="font-size:large;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312113668/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwnomorefake-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0312113668" target="_blank"><i>Toxic Psychiatry</i></a></span></span></span>, Dr. Peter Breggin, St. Martin&#8217;s Press, 1991)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This psychiatric drug plague is accelerating across the land.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Where are the mainstream reporters and editors and newspapers and TV anchors who should be breaking this story and mercilessly hammering on it week after week? They are in harness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And Dr. Frances is somehow let off the hook. He&#8217;s admitted in print that the whole basis of his profession is throwing darts at labels on a wall, and implies the “effort” is rather heroic—when, in fact, the effort leads to more and more poisonous drugs being dispensed to adults and children, to say nothing of the effect of being diagnosed with “a mental disorder.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m <i>not</i> talking about “the mental-disease stigma,” the removal of which is one of Hillary Clinton&#8217;s missions in life. No, I&#8217;m talking about MOVING A HUMAN INTO THE SYSTEM, the psychiatric apparatus, where the essence of the game is trapping that person to harvest his money, his time, his energy, and of course his health&#8212;as one new diagnosis follows on another, and one new toxic treatment after another is undertaken, from cradle to grave. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The result is a severely debilitated human being (if he survives), whose major claim to fame is his list of diseases and disorders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Thank you, Dr. Frances. </span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here is a smoking-gun statement made by another prominent psychiatrist, on an episode of PBS’ Frontline series. The episode was: </span><em><span style="font-size:large;">“Does ADHD Exist?”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">PBS FRONTLINE INTERVIEWER: Skeptics say that there’s no biological marker—that it [ADHD] is the one condition out there where there is no blood test, and that no one knows what causes it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">BARKLEY (<i>Dr. Russell Barkley, professor of psychiatry and neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center</i>): That’s tremendously naïve, and it shows a great deal of illiteracy about science and about the mental health professions. </span><em><span style="font-size:large;">A disorder doesn’t have to have a blood test to be valid. If that were the case, all mental disorders would be invalid…There is no lab test for any mental disorder right now in our science.</span></em> <span style="font-size:large;">That doesn’t make them invalid. [emphasis added]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Without intending to, Dr. Barkley blows the whistle on his own profession. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">So let’s take Dr. Barkley to school. Medical science, and disease-research in particular, rests on the notion that you can make a diagnosis backed up by lab tests. If you can’t produce lab tests, you’re spinning fantasies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">These fantasies might be hopeful, they might be “educated guesses,” they might be launched from traditional centers of learning, they might be backed up by billions of dollars of grant money…but they’re still fantasies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If I said the moon was made of green cheese, even if I were a Harvard professor, sooner or later someone would ask me to produce a sample of moon rock to be tested for “cheese qualities.” I might begin to feel nervous, I might want to tap dance around the issue, but I would have to submit the rock to a lab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Dr. Barkley employs a corrupted version of logical analysis in his statement to the PBS Frontline interviewer. Barkley is essentially saying, “There is no lab test for any mental disorder. But if a test were the standard of proof, we wouldn’t have science at all, and that would mean our whole profession rests on nothing&#8212;and that is absurd, so therefore a test doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">That logic is no logic at all. Barkley is proving the case against himself. He just doesn’t want to admit it. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">Close to 50 years ago, psychiatry was dying out as a profession. Fewer and fewer people wanted to see a psychiatrist for help, for talk therapy. All sorts of new therapies were popping up. The competition was leaving medical psychiatry in the dust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">As Dr. Peter Breggin describes it in his landmark book, <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="font-size:large;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312113668/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwnomorefake-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0312113668" target="_blank"><i>Toxic Psychiatry</i></a></span></span></span>, a deal was struck. Drug companies would bankroll psychiatry and rescue it. These companies would pour money into professional conferences, journals, research. In return, they wanted “science” that would promote mental disease as a biological fact, a gateway into the drugs. Everyone would win&#8212;except the patient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">So the studies were rolled out, and the list of mental disorders expanded. The FDA was in on the deal as well, as evidenced by their drug “safety” approvals, in the face of the obvious damage these drugs were doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">So this is how we arrived at where we are. This was the plan, and it worked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Under the cover story, it was all fraud all the time. Without much of a stretch, you could say psychiatry has been the most widespread profiling operation in the history of the human race. Its goal has been to bring humans everywhere into its system. It hardly matters which label a person is painted with, as long as it adds up to a diagnosis and a prescription of drugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Do people suffer, do they have problems, do they experience anguish and pain, do they make choices that sabotage their own interests, do they fall victim to external circumstances, do they long for relief? Of course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But this nothing to do with fraudulent psychiatric diagnoses. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">by Jon Rappoport</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">September 27, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>Nothing&#8217;s been done about that story [the Seal Team raid on the Osama bin Laden compound], it&#8217;s one big lie, not one word of it is true.” (Seymour Hersh)</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This is the thing. They thought they could rush John Smith, the most famous television anchor in the world, to Bellevue, after he went off on his news broadcast. They thought they could sneak him through the back door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But the hospital was surrounded by reporters with camera crews when they got there. And Smith wasn&#8217;t drugged yet, nor was he was in a straitjacket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He stepped out of the ambulance and saw&#8230;an audience. He immediately perked up. He smiled. He stood there in the driveway, ran his hands through his hair, and gestured at the men in suits who flanked him.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">These security people,” he said, “ believe I&#8217;m crazy. I&#8217;m not and I want to make a brief statement before they take me inside and do God knows what to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Applause broke out. And some laughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The guards looked at each other and froze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">A tall blonde standing 20 feet away from Smith tore off her blouse and stood naked from the waist up in the dying light of the summer evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Cheers. Some of cameras swiveled to pick her up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">(She was a backup plant in the crowd.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">WE LOVE YOU, SMITH, she said in a clear voice.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Well,” Smith said, “I&#8217;m sure this is a wonderful moment of distraction for all of us, but in the history of the world, breasts are nothing new. Check that. I&#8217;d say yours look like Marty Cohen&#8217;s work. I should know. My first wife was his patient. Marty&#8217;s an artist. He has an office in McLean. Does some of the CIA wives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Big laughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The blonde suddenly looked worried. She put her blouse back on and melted into the crowd.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">So,” Smith said, “now that we&#8217;ve got the commercial out of the way, let&#8217;s get to the heart of things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The laughter died down. The crowd went quiet. The cameras were rolling.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">About an hour ago, I was doing the news and I said, &#8216;This is ridiculous, I can&#8217;t go on with this, it&#8217;s stupid and I don&#8217;t want any more deceptions.&#8217; They cut to commercial and before I knew it I was in an ambulance headed for this funny farm.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I operate as a mouthpiece. The way I speak on television sets up frequencies and rhythms that are hypnotic. It&#8217;s a skill you hone if you want to rise in this business.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">My tone is flat, it&#8217;s objective, it&#8217;s a bit tough and tender, as if I&#8217;m concealing, but just barely, a sympathy for the common people and their plight.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">In fact, I know very few common people, and my sympathies lie with myself, my position, my career, my front. Of course I love my family, and I have close friends, but what I do, what I&#8217;m paid very good money to do is shape consensus.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It may seem strange to consider it, but reality&#8230;public shared reality is a fiction. I ought to know. I invent that fiction every night on the news. That&#8217;s my job.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">If I do it well, I&#8217;m a star, and the people behind the people who pay me are happy. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m not suffering from a nervous breakdown. The stress of the job hasn&#8217;t gotten to me. I don&#8217;t have a mental disorder. I&#8217;m not crazy. I&#8217;m just tired of inventing the fiction.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I don&#8217;t like it anymore. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">First of all, I give you news without context. I never fill in the blanks that would make the stories of our time have meaning. I don&#8217;t tell you about the natural gas pipeline through Syria or the long-time plan to destabilize Syria and the whole Middle East. I don&#8217;t come right out and say the US government is arming and backing the very same terrorists they claim to be fighting. I omit that. I omit context.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Therefore, you don&#8217;t have a chance in hell of understanding the news. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Then I also omit altogether certain stories that would shake you to the core and crack the pillars of our way of life. For example, I don&#8217;t come out and say the Federal Reserve is actual a gang of private bankers pretending to be part of the government, a gang that manipulates the value of money and creates money out of thin air.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I don&#8217;t say that the medical apparatus in this country kills, at minimum, 225,000 people a year. I don&#8217;t do simple arithmetic and tell you that means doctors are killing TWO POINT TWO FIVE MILLION AMERICANS PER DECADE.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">If I did say these things on the nightly news, I&#8217;d be ripping apart the fictional reality I invent for you.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Then, when it comes to what are politely and inaccurately called scandals, I don&#8217;t press the issue. I don&#8217;t pound on these stories night after night, going deeper, finding the criminals who are responsible, who should be locked up for rest of their lives.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">If I set my hounds loose, my reporters, if I took the leash off them, on, say, a story like Benghazi, and if I issued updates every night for three or four months, I&#8217;d tear a huge hole in the consensus-reality fabric. Murder, weapons transfers to terrorists. Naming names. Relentlessly.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I don&#8217;t do that. I wouldn&#8217;t last a day on the job if I did.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">My whole life has been a lead-up, a preparation for a grand simulation. Do you see? From the time I was a boy, I realized there was this thing called simulation.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s like a cartoon, but it&#8217;s a serious cartoon. And I realized I could narrate these animations, I could make people believe them.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">My voice. The cultivation of a voice. A believable telling of a tale. It was easy for me. I found out how I could relate to people and get them to trust me.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I saw INTO what they wanted. A feeling of security, a feeling that things are all right. And, I thought, why shouldn&#8217;t they want that? If I can give it to them, I&#8217;m performing a valuable service. Everybody wants that.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">From this core, a long time ago, I shaped my persona, my attitude, my way of speaking and responding. To use an old phrase, I was &#8216;other-directed.&#8217; From all appearances, I wasn&#8217;t interested in myself.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">That became my motto and my religion. DON&#8217;T BE INTERESTED IN YOURSELF. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">But somewhere along the line, a confusion set in. I was doing good, I was giving people what they wanted, I was keeping my own desires in check. I was narrating stories. And yet, the outcome&#8230;the outcome was twisted.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I wasn&#8217;t a therapist or a chaplain or a teacher trying to help people get their lives back. I was a broadcaster, a news man. I was supposed to take a direct line to the truth, and when I found it, I was supposed to travel even deeper, into the dark places where the lies are manufactured.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">But you see, I was in a dark place, and I was manufacturing lies.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s taken me many years to admit this contradiction and see it squarely.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">In the process, I&#8217;ve seen more and more of what we call reality and how it&#8217;s MADE. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;ll tell you this. If I could somehow retain the public platform I&#8217;ve built, I would spend the rest of my life doing nothing but showing HOW IT&#8217;S MADE. That would be my job.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">But of course, that&#8217;s impossible. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">These men beside me are going to take me into this hospital, and a psychiatrist is going to interview me and diagnose me with a mental disorder. </span></p>

<hr />
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">And most of you will believe the news reports about me. You&#8217;ll accept the reality that psychiatrists invent out of thin air. You&#8217;ll shake your heads and say, &#8216;It&#8217;s too bad what happened to Smith. I always liked him. Now I&#8217;m going to have to find another person, another voice, another face, another anchor to make reality for me every night.&#8217;</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Well, you won&#8217;t put it that way. But that is the situation.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Who is going to make reality for you? The eternal search.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">How many of you will realize that you, individually, can make it for yourself, that the whole notion of a collective consensus is fatally flawed, that CONSENSUS is a gigantic teaser for the upcoming news? </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">There is one thing you can do for me now. In this country, we still have a few freedoms, a few protections. I don&#8217;t have to submit to someone, a psychiatrist, telling me what my state of mind is.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I can declare my own state of mind.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">On the off-chance that I might not be crazy, that I do have the right to assert and judge my own thoughts, you can intercede at this moment.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Do you understand?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The crowd was silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Everything was suddenly very still.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Then&#8230;one beat. Two beats. Three beats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">THEY SURGED FORWARD.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">A few hundred people moved forward and got between Smith and his guards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The cameras kept rolling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The crowd formed a cordon around Smith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And that was the way they walked back out of the driveway and into the street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The sun had set. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It was night. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">September 26, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The reference here is USA Today, September 17, “Shooting Rampage at Navy Yard Leaves 13 Dead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This isn&#8217;t some little local paper. It&#8217;s big-time national media. So one would expect that, when it develops a crucial story line, it would follow up on it, press it, keep digging into it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here is the USA Today quote from 9/17:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><i>“A federal law enforcement official said Monday that Alexis, who had been staying at a nearby Residence Inn since late August or early September, legally purchased at least some of the weapons used in the assault within the past few days in Virginia.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><i>“Alexis allegedly drove to the Navy Yard complex with the weapons early Monday and cleared security checkpoints before parking in a lot on the property, said the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly. <u>After leaving his car, it is believed that Alexis was involved in two altercations in which he opened fire, killing one or possibly two people</u>. (emphasis added)</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><i>“The official said Alexis then entered the building and went to the third and fourth floors, where much of the assault was carried out…”</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This is an entirely different picture of the shooting. It&#8217;s not the official version. And now we have video purporting to show Aaron Alexis entering the Navy Yard building, with his bag, without a hitch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">No presentation of credentials at the door. No guards present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If, as the USA Today federal source describes, Alexis shot several people in the parking garage BEFORE entering the building and killed at least one person, you would assume that would spark an immediate security call and lockdown of the building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Alexis would have met heavy armed resistance before entering the building. But according to the video, he didn&#8217;t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">So what really happened?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">No word. No retraction from USA Today. No followup from USA Today or any other major media outlet.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Just drop it. Who cares? It doesn&#8217;t fit with the official narrative. Let it go. Move on. We have a new story line. He never shot anybody in the parking garage. He walked into the building unhindered. So be it&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Really?</span></p>

<p><a title="The Matrix Revealed" href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/the-matrix-revealed-vol-1-mp3s-pdfs-by-jon-rappoport-mega-info/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-2732"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2732" alt="The Matrix Revealed" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/matrixrevealed3.jpg?w=640"   /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The public is so used to this kind of press-coverage YES then NO dump-a-story-and-walk-away tactic, they don&#8217;t even register it anymore.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">His father was dead in New Jersey? No? His mother was dead in Connecticut? He had to pass inspection from a video camera in the principal&#8217;s office before he could get into the school? He got in anyway? He had three guns? No, two? One? There were two other shooters? No, one? No? None? He was the only one? Okay. Whatever they say.” (Sandy Hook)</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What? Two witnesses saw another shooter in the theater? What happened to that story line? Where are witnesses now? Where&#8217;s the other shooter? Oh, there wasn&#8217;t one. Okay, no problem.” (Aurora, Colorado)</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What? Witnesses say there were shooters besides Harris and Klebold in the school? Where did they go? Where are the witnesses now?” (Columbine; search for “Columbine 101 witnesses What Really Happened” to read what 101 witnesses have to say about other shooters.)</span></p>
<hr />
<p><a title="Exit From the Matrix" href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/exit-from-the-matrix/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3550"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3550" alt="Exit From the Matrix" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/matrix-exit1.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">A federal official tells USA Today that Alexis SHOT PEOPLE IN THE PARKING GARAGE. Are you kidding? And then he strolls into the building a few minutes later and nobody stops him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">An eight-year old with a few active brain cells calls this a contradiction. But USA Today and every other major media outlet call it nothing. Just one of those glitches. Happens in every story like this. Don&#8217;t worry your pretty little head about it. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">They always get it wrong at first. Then they get it right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You mean, “Somebody lets the cat out of the bag and then they put the cat back in”?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If indeed Alexis or someone else shot and killed people in the parking garage before the shooting in the building started, then we have the kind of security breach that does far more than inspire a call for a “review of security” at all naval installations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">We have a completely different account of what actually happened at the Navy Yard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">For example: other shooters; doctored FBI video; a planned and coordinated op.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Oh, don&#8217;t be silly. The FBI needed time to put the evidence together, and now they have. Everything&#8217;s correct.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Why?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Because it has to be. Otherwise, reality is not what it seems.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">September 26, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Yes, a whole lot of boys and girls are paying $150,000 for a T-shirt. Now that&#8217;s a sales job. We&#8217;re not talking about about a purse that costs three grand or a $500 bottle of bitter champagne or 10 grand for a vacation cruise that gives you a solid case of dysentery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This is a really sublime con. And I have a solution for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The student enrolls in what I simply call The Course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He goes to the library once a week and checks out a stack of books. Any books. For four hours a day, five days a week, for six years, you chain him to a table in a quiet room at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">There&#8217;s a thick notebook on the table and pencils. And the books. No computer. No phone. No videos. No music. No nothing. You walk out and close the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">That&#8217;s it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The rest is up to him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">During his six years, the student might read and/or write about television, space travel, the process of elephants giving birth, soldier ants, the CIA, God, the suppression of bubblegum sales during World War 2, an analysis of photographs of desert mirages, Jesus, the Rockefellers, malaria, ghosts, football, worship of idols in ancient Polynesia, the evolution of the hot dog, syphilis, leprosy, plutonium, Plato, gastric ulcers, Middle East wars, building houses out of rubber tires, the Federal Reserve, cell phone radiation&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Or he might do nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s his choice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Nobody teaches him anything. Nobody checks up on him. Nobody encourages him. Nobody guides him. Nobody tests him or grades him or graduates him. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">This is the first and last time I&#8217;ll be speaking to you about The Course. You&#8217;re going to start today. Good luck.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;ll put that up against any liberal arts curriculum in America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And of course, it has a Zen component. Silence. Inevitable confusion. Resentment. The need for answers which never come. Frustration. Choice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And it&#8217;s free. No T-shirt, no student loans, no government interference, no administration, no brainwashing, no social agenda, no sense of entitlement, no hype.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">There&#8217;s a chance the student may actually become interested in something ON HIS OWN. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If not, so be it. He has no one to blame. </span></p>

<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I guess I&#8217;m not curious about what I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m a robot. So I&#8217;ll just go to the nearest programming center and sign up. They can make me over into whatever they need. No problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In case you haven&#8217;t noticed, our society has become obsessed, at every possible level, with meddling in other people business. I&#8217;m not talking about honest prosecution of crimes. I&#8217;m talking about downright interference.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Don&#8217;t you think you should be doing THIS?” Shouldn&#8217;t you stop doing THAT?” “Don&#8217;t you care about what your grandmother THINKS?”</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The Course is meddle-free. So even if a student comes out of his six years with nothing, at least he know what&#8217;s it&#8217;s like to exist, for four hours a day, in a non-meddling space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And his parents get the message as well.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I just want to take Jimmy some tea and cookies while he&#8217;s studying.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Hold on, Martha, don&#8217;t you remember when we signed the contract, it said no interruptions? If you walk in there, they can come and shoot you. And I believe they will. They were very emphatic on that point.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I want to make sure he&#8217;s all right.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Here&#8230;let me read from their leaflet: &#8216;You as the parent may experience a grinding need to walk in on your precious little doofus while he&#8217;s doing The Course. Recognize this comes from your craven fear of being alone with nothing but your own thoughts. You&#8217;re assuredly deranged. Should you ignore this warning, your child will be only too happy to report you, we will take you out, and it won&#8217;t be pretty&#8230;&#8217;” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I believe The Course is an idea whose time has come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Bonus: you can ignore the towers of absolute crap the government shovels about education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The Course is stark and uncompromising. Beauty comes in many forms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">Now and then, if you take a popular advertising or PR slogan and turn it backwards, you get something more interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Remember GE&#8217;s “Progress is our most important product”? Try “Product is our most important progress.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Or “There&#8217;s no I in team” becomes “There&#8217;s no team in I.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">More esoteric? If you have a little surrealism in your blood, you can do a Zen koan with “Think outside the box,” making it, “Box outside the think.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Propaganda mainly exists to put the truth backwards, because for some reason people like it that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The Vatican has some high-level propaganda pros working for it. They float the idea that in-house pedophiles are just occasional wanderers from the ethical status quo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Whereas the priesthood is closer to an ad for men who like little boys.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You can wear an official robe and we&#8217;ll protect you. If you get caught, we&#8217;ll move you around from diocese to diocese until you disappear, and you&#8217;ll never have to serve a day in jail or pay a fine. Ask yourself if this profession is right for you&#8230;” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The government wants us to believe that alternatives to oil are extremely difficult to come by (except for nuke reactors that can destroy life on Earth).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Presidents will always pay lip service to gaining independence from foreign oil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But this is all backwards propaganda. The truth runs more like this: “We want to fight wars and control land and kill people and blow up whatever we can. We need a reason to do that. So, when we talk to influential corporate types and insiders, we focus on energy. We say we have to keep the oil flowing, that&#8217;s why we go in there and destabilize countries and set up new puppets and kill, kill, kill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">What? Energy isn&#8217;t the real reason?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">No it isn&#8217;t. The real reason is lunatics want to kill people and control land.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here&#8217;s how you make energy. You turn a wheel. Call it a turbine. Set up the wheel in conjunction with magnetic fields, and you can produce energy. Electricity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Those huge dams? Those nuke plants? They end up turning wheels. Water, steam. They spin the wheel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Well, there is this thing called the ocean. You may have heard of it. And then there are smaller narrower versions called rivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The water moves. It flows. It&#8217;s strong. Small turbines in rivers and larger ones in coastal inlets, where the ocean tide varies from quite high to low&#8212;and you can turn the wheel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s not that perplexing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If you want to get fancy, you can build plants offshore and split water into hydrogen and oxygen and use the hydrogen for energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here&#8217;s where the domeheads enter the scene and exclaim this is all about “cost-effectiveness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">No it isn&#8217;t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If you need to, check out the history of government subsidies and loopholes that exist for people who make oil in the ground into energy and nuke factories hum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Do you think these industries survive on pure free-market capitalism? Kidding? They&#8217;re supported. All sorts of deals shore up their back-end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">So, on a far, far lesser scale, ocean/river turbines and hydrogen from sea water might need a subsidy boost, but compared to oil and nukes, we&#8217;re talking pennies on the dollar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Energy independence has been there for us, for a long time, but that isn&#8217;t the point. The military industrial complex doesn&#8217;t want it. They want to fight wars, and they need a reason they can give to “people in the know”: oil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s all backwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The propaganda is enormous. It includes numerous psyops designed to make the public believe in energy shortages, as well as “necessary wars.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">These people and their allies are inventing, day by day, a reality that implies the need for war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Read “The Dream of Passamaquoddy,” the story of the Maine tidal electricity project JFK supported for many years. It&#8217;s a prime illustration of how a feasible source of energy was stalled, deflected, wrapped in red tape, politicized, and undermined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">To understand war, start with the psychology of the men who make it happen. They may talk about geopolitics and energy, but they&#8217;re obsessed with attacking, destroying, and killing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">They&#8217;re Attila the Hun in suits and military uniforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In the delusion called consensus reality, whole populations admire these gangsters, who represent the generalized desire for some kind of revenge against life-as-it-is.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Okay, boys, all of us in this room here are on the same page. We can let down our guard. We know we love to kill and maim and bomb and enslave and take over land. That&#8217;s what we live for. So we need to ID some valuable thing we say is very, very scarce, without which life as we know it wouldn&#8217;t exist. Get it? And we privately tell Presidents and legislators and heavy hitters we have to go to war to safeguard this very scarce thing and make sure we can still obtain it. Ha-ha. And for our purposes, the thing is ENERGY. Right? We do whatever it takes to make everybody believe energy is scarce and hard to come by and limited and so on, and war is okay because we fight to make sure we have access to energy. It&#8217;s all backwards&#8230;but who cares?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">WE NEED TO FIGHT WARS TO SECURE ENERGY SOURCES is really WE NEED ENERGY TO FIGHT WARS BECAUSE WE WANT TO FIGHT WARS. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;"><i>Pieces of what consciousness creates linger and form a kind of landscape. A person consults it, as if it were a guide, over and over, until his life wears out, feels old, bores him to the point where he wants something new.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><i>He can linger and grow old staring at this landscape painting, or he can imagine and invent novel things.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><i>(Unfinished manuscript, The Magician Awakes) </i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In view of the response I received to my article, <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2013/09/21/one-page-proof-that-attributing-consciousness-to-the-brain-is-absurd/" target="_blank">“Proof that attributing consciousness to the brain is absurd,”</a></span></span> I&#8217;m adding a few remarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Take this “scientific” assertion: if you have the complex concentration of particles known as the brain, who knows what they might produce? They might bring about consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Who knows? An ant hill might produce a full-size limousine made out of raspberry jello. A box of burner phones in a police evidence locker might give rise to a new moon orbiting Jupiter. Who knows? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The “who knows” and “might” argument is a far cry from the claim of conventional physics that consciousness HAS to arise from the brain because that&#8217;s all we have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Then we have the ever-popular “consciousness is a mystical entity” proposition. In this case, not only is consciousness a vague cloudy thing, the statements about it are also vague and cloudy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Therefore, anything goes. Consciousness exists in the 18<sup>th</sup> dimension. Consciousness was born in the roots of a tree centered in a black hole three trillion light years east of Hoboken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Many fairy tales spring from the idea that consciousness is a Something. The Something usually ends up being energy. What kind of energy? Take your pick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">There are many errors that derive from the fact that people like to label whatever they can with a noun. Consciousness, a noun. Therefore, a thing. Well, suppose consciousness is a situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And the situation is: people are aware. They know they&#8217;re alive. They know they&#8217;re looking and talking and thinking and doing&#8212;which, by the way, is not the situation of a machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This is why the technocratic blather about connecting the brain with computers for the purpose of infinite enhancement is a joke. It&#8217;s all on the level of mechanical process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">A machine can assist human choices, but it can&#8217;t think, and it isn&#8217;t aware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;re aware. I&#8217;m aware. That isn&#8217;t a thing and it isn&#8217;t “energy” and it isn&#8217;t a mystical cloud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Neither is it restricted. What the conscious-you can become aware of is unbounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Being conscious is a non-material situation. Physics isn&#8217;t equipped to talk about it, because physics explores matter and energy, time and space. Consciousness isn&#8217;t any of those things. It&#8217;s, again, non-material.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Various elites don&#8217;t want to admit that, because “non-material” implies “can&#8217;t be externally shaped and controlled.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Unfortunately, most people, when confronted with “unbounded” automatically go to “mystical.” This has resulted in numerous problems, including the hypnotic power of various priest-classes down through history, who have ruled societies with iron claws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">At its philosophical root, consciousness has been warred over by both materialistic and mystical forces, each claiming ownership, for different reasons, over that which belongs only to each person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Fascism, Communism, scientism on one side assert their “consciousness=brain” absurdity, while on the other side, various heavily organized religious institutions promote their elite and exclusive keys to mystical consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Neither side is the slightest bit interested in individual freedom or the fully independent conscious human.</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><b>They&#8217;re dogs fighting over a piece of meat that isn&#8217;t even meat.</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here are several more quotes from The Magician Awakes:</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>Scientism undermines consciousness, or tries to, by disparaging its essential poetic nature. Consciousness can revolutionize the lunatic consensus we call reality by forging it into poetry.”</i></span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>Suffering and pain and isolation keep giving themselves up to art and artists, to be transformed. The paradox is, if artists (which means everyone) took that offer in a full-blooded way, we would all rise to another level of life in which much of the suffering would no longer be necessary.”</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><i>What consciousness can invent is, in terms of mystery and joy and complexity, light years beyond what is said about the nature of consciousness&#8230;” </i></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">September 22, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Send your child to college, and watch him earn a mental-disorder diagnosis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">What better target-rich environment for pharma/psychiatry to exploit than colleges?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Constantly renewing enrollments of the young and vulnerable, under pressure to perform academically, away from home for the first time, becoming aware that a degree may earn them zero security in the shrinking job market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Through on-campus counseling services, feeder lines channel students into psychiatrists&#8217; office. Some colleges even have “crisis response teams” to guide students with problems into the heart of psychiatric-drug darkness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The JED Foundation is an example of a group that networks with colleges to set up comprehensive systems for mental-health services. It boasts two past presidents of the American Psychiatric Association on its boards. JED&#8217;s medical director, Dr. Victor Schwartz, writes:</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">In the past year, 21.2 percent of college students received a psychiatric diagnosis or were treated for mental health issues such as depression or eating disorders, and an estimated 6.6 percent of students reported having serious thoughts of suicide&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">One out of five college students in the psychiatric pipeline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And this figure is going to increase, in the wake of “cautionary events” like the Aurora, Sandy Hook, and Navy Yard shootings, which are being promoted as posters for earlier “mental-health interventions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Watch for it. The “see something, say something” mantra of the DHS will cross over. “If you see a fellow student exhibiting the following signs, it&#8217;s your duty to say something to the college counseling office&#8230;treatment is the answer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If you went to college, I&#8217;ll bet you can remember numerous moments when&#8212;if a “mental-health atmosphere” had pervaded the campus&#8212;a psychiatrist would have diagnosed you with a disorder and <b>prescribed a toxic drug</b>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s now an open secret (even mainstream news outlets are sticking their toes in the water) that the SSRI antidepressants induce violence, including suicide and homicide. See <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.ssristories.com/index.php" target="_blank">SSRI Stories</a></span></span> for many sourced accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Psychiatry is random MKULTRA in the express lane. Drug millions, stand back, and watch the violence spread like blood on a blotter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">One of my many articles on medical fraud, <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2013/05/07/the-lying-liars-who-lie-about-psychiatry/" target="_blank">“The lying liars who lie about psychiatry,”</a></span></span> establishes that: there are no definitive physical diagnostic tests for ANY so-called mental disorder; therefore, these disorders are rank fictions; and drugs used to treat patients are highly toxic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">There are, in fact, many reasons why people in general, and college students in particular, go off the rails, suffer, feel pain, experience disorientation, wrestle with problems they can&#8217;t resolve: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Severe nutritional deficits; prior toxic medical drugs; environmental chemicals; food sensitivities; peer pressure; physical and emotional abuse; vaccine injury; oxygen-deficit; head injuries. The list goes on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Health practitioners who have the knowledge and take the time can discover particular causes in a given patient. In many cases, these problems can be reversed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The concept called “mental disorder” is a sales pitch backed up by extraordinary PR, money, academic gibberish, and government-granted official status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">After the recent mass killings in Aurora, Sandy Hook, Boston, and Washington, psychiatry is flying high. It&#8217;s doubling down on its lies, and making a case, with its federal allies and media know-nothings, for more intervention, more diagnosis, more drugs, more “surveillance of early warning signs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">People need to wake up to the fact that the whole panoply of human suffering has been co-opted, taken over, redefined, re-translated into a lexicon of pseudoscience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This would be bad enough, <b>but when you add the toxic and violence-inducing drugs to the mix</b>, you have an underworld of RICO crime the mafia could only dream of. Because it&#8217;s right out in the open, and its priests in white coats can even testify in court trials as experts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">Waking up is hard to do, for people who&#8217;ve already bought the premise of mental health. They hope against hope (and thus believe) that the cure is here, the analysis is real, the science is true. They imagine that only Neanderthals would reject psychiatry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">They trust in promises of the march of progress. They believe the press releases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">They send their children to college. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">They pay the price of their faith. Their son or daughter is now in the psychiatric system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here is one such story, from Dr, Peter Breggin&#8217;s landmark book, <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="font-size:large;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312113668/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwnomorefake-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0312113668" target="_blank"><i>Toxic Psychiatry</i></a></span></span></span>:</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Roberta was a college student, getting good grades, mostly A’s, when she first became depressed and sought psychiatric help at the recommendation of her university health service. She was eighteen at the time, bright and well motivated, and a very good candidate for psychotherapy. She was going through a sophomore-year identity crisis about dating men, succeeding in school, and planning a future. She could have thrived with a sensitive therapist who had an awareness of women’s issues.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Instead of moral support and insight, her doctor gave her Haldol. Over the next four years, six different physicians watched her deteriorate neurologically without warning her or her family about tardive dyskinesia [motor brain damage] and without making the [tardive dyskinesia] diagnosis, even when she was overtly twitching in her arms and legs. Instead they switched her from one neuroleptic to another, including Navane, Stelazine, and Thorazine. Eventually a rehabilitation therapist became concerned enough to send her to a general physician, who made the diagnosis [of medical drug damage]. By then she was permanently physically disabled, with a loss of 30 percent of her IQ.</span></p>
<p>“…<span style="font-size:large;">my medical evaluation described her condition: Roberta is a grossly disfigured and severely disabled human being who can no longer control her body. She suffers from extreme writhing movements and spasms involving the face, head, neck, shoulders, limbs, extremities, torso, and back-nearly the entire body. She had difficulty standing, sitting, or lying down, and the difficulties worsen as she attempts to carry out voluntary actions. At one point she could not prevent her head from banging against nearby furniture. She could hold a cup to her lip only with great difficulty. Even her respiratory movements are seriously afflicted so that her speech comes out in grunts and gasps amid spasms of her respiratory muscles…Roberta may improve somewhat after several months off the neuroleptic drugs, but she will never again have anything remotely resembling a normal life.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">September 21, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Consider this an open letter to philosophers, brain researchers, physicists, technocrats, Ray Kurzweil, and TED executives who censored lectures on consciousness by Graham Hancock and Rupert Sheldrake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Conventional science readily admits (insists) that the brain is made of the same particles that constitute everything else in the universe: rocks, chairs, comets, meteors, galaxies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">According to conventional physicists, these particles are not conscious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Therefore, there is no reason to conclude the brain is conscious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The brain has no more ability to spawn consciousness than a rock does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">End of story. End of proof.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;re welcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Of course, a few scientists will argue (and many more will privately believe) that, since we humans ARE conscious, this proves the brain is producing consciousness&#8212;because, where else could we look for an explanation?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Which is called circular reasoning. Meaning: you already assume what you&#8217;re trying to prove. Any first-semester logic student would mark that argument INVALID. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Some scientists, suddenly invoking a brand of mysticism they otherwise deplore, claim the unique complex configuration of particles called the brain somehow&#8212;in this one case&#8212;has a capacity to break every rule in the book and deliver consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But no proof, just faith. Supposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Finally, you have a sprinkling of renegade physicists who assert that everything in the universe&#8212;rocks, chairs, pencils, lamps, trees, stars, galaxies are conscious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Fine. However, their argument trivializes the brain as the seat of consciousness, because the human arm and leg and thumb and belly button and butt are all conscious, too. In which case, so what?</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Bottom line? All conventional scientific arguments for the brain as the “place of consciousness” are futile and absurd. And this leads to something beyond scientific and philosophic materialism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It leads to non-material consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The failure of physicists to admit this is just pure stubbornness, avoidance, and rank denial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Their only refuge is to deny consciousness exists. Instead, all life is merely mechanical. “Consciousness” is a fake delusion/concept contained in faulty programming, and installing better programming will make humans more “realistic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This is the fall-back position of the technocrats, and it enables them to try any and all transhuman experiments, since humans are just machines. Take out this wire, insert that wire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This brand of technocrat isn&#8217;t just a wacko who thinks storing a computer clone of a human brain is storing a human being. No. He&#8217;s a rabid Dr. Frankenstein.</span></p>

<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>Martine Rothblatt, CEO of biotech company United Therapeutics introduced the idea of &#8216;mindclones.&#8217; These are digital versions of humans that can live forever and can create &#8216;mindfiles&#8217; that are a place to store aspects of our personalities. She said it would run on a kind of software for consciousness&#8230;” (Daily Mail, June 19, 2013)</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The year was 2082. A Googhoo representative walked into Dr. James Allen&#8217;s office. The rep was wearing a T-shirt printed with a message:</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">AT FIRST WE THOUGHT CONSCIOUSNESS WAS THE BRAIN. THEN WE THOUGHT IT WAS A PULSE FROM THE UNIVERSE. THEN WE REALIZED IT WAS ENERGY SURROUNDING THE BODY. BREAKTHROUGH!” </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Ah, Millstone,” Dr. Allen said to the rep, “I was wondering when you would show up. We&#8217;re done, aren&#8217;t we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Millstone nodded and sat down in a soft chair near the window. The shades were drawn. Dr. Allen sat down on the floor close by.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">So” Allen said. “What is your finding?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Well,” Millstone said, “we managed to corral your consciousness over a period of three months. We trapped it in our lab and sealed it in a glass room. It took up an area of seventeen by thirty-seven feet.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Really.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Yes.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">And you&#8217;re satisfied you gathered up all of it?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Why of course,” Millstone said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Then on what basis am I sitting here listening to you and understanding what you&#8217;re saying?” Allen said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Millstone smiled.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I knew you would ask me that. My answer is simple. You&#8217;re now operating purely on nerve transmissions and impulses. It&#8217;s automatic.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I see,” Dr. Allen said. “So although I THINK I&#8217;m conscious at this moment, I&#8217;m deluded. I&#8217;m a biological machine. You&#8217;ve got all my consciousness in that room.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Exactly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Allen said, “What did you discover in your experiment?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">First of all, you&#8217;re still alive and coherent. That means we can clone and create biological machines from scratch without consciousness, and they&#8217;ll operate as efficiently as you are right now.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">And second?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You retain the delusion that you&#8217;re conscious. It doesn&#8217;t seem to fade away. So we can grab anyone&#8217;s consciousness, analyze it, profile it, and understand a great deal about that human. He won&#8217;t even know what we&#8217;re doing. It adds to our&#8212;</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Spying capability,” Allen said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I wouldn&#8217;t put it that way,” Millstone said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Well,” Allen said. “There&#8217;s only one flaw in your reasoning. It&#8217;s fatal, of course, but don&#8217;t blame me. It&#8217;s your own shortsightedness.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What do you mean?” Millstone said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You assume you were taking my consciousness. Suppose you weren&#8217;t?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What could we possibly have taken instead?” Millstone said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You define consciousness as energy. You homed in on the energy around my body. You snatched it. But consciousness is non-material. It&#8217;s not energy. I reconstructed the energy you stole. I put it back. I could do that because I&#8217;m in full possession of my faculties. I&#8217;m conscious. I have my consciousness.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Impossible,” Millstone said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Are you sure?” Allen said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Millstone took a small device out of his jacket pocket. He pointed it at Allen and watched its screen flash sequences of numbers. He slumped back in his chair.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You see?” Allen said. “All that energy you took is back again. Your experiment was a bust from the beginning. That&#8217;s what I was betting on. You just wasted what? A few billion dollars?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">No, no, no. Consciousness IS energy!” Millstone said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Really? You actually think energy is what makes you and I conscious of each other right now? No, Millstone. It&#8217;s much simpler than that. Don&#8217;t you get it? You ARE conscious. So am I. Sucking away energy doesn&#8217;t change that.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Entirely unsatisfactory,” Millstone said. “If you&#8217;re right, we can&#8217;t measure consciousness because it isn&#8217;t made out of ANYTHING.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Yes,” Allen said. “That&#8217;s right. Correct.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Millstone took a small gun out of his pocket.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What are you doing?” Allen said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m going to kill myself,” Millstone said. “The whole project is a failure.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Wait a minute,” Allen said. “You&#8217;re telling me that discovering you&#8217;re CONSCIOUS is a cause for suicide?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">If I can&#8217;t MEASURE that,” Millstone said, “what good is it? What good am I?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Think of it this way,” Allen said. “Being conscious is non-material. You are non-material.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Millstone smirked.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Then it shouldn&#8217;t matter if I kill myself,” he said. “I can&#8217;t really die.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This is your bet, or are you just acting out of desperation?” Allen said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What difference does it make?” Millstone said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He raised the gun to his head. He pulled the trigger. There was a loud pop. He fell off his chair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">After they came and questioned him and took the body away, another scientist from Googhoo showed up. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Millstone had been feeling despondent lately,” he said. “He was afraid the experiment wouldn&#8217;t pan out. What did he tell you?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Well,” Allen said, “he was quite upbeat when he got here. He took a few measurements and discovered the whole thing was a flop.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I see,” the scientist said. “Would you mind if I did my own measurements on you? It&#8217;ll only take a minute.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;d rather rest,” Allen said. “After what just happened&#8230;”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I understand completely,” the scientist said. “I&#8217;ll call you in a few days and come back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">After the scientist left, Allen sat in his office thinking. “Are these crazies going to traipse in here, one by one, take measurements, realize their whole experiment is failure, and then kill themselves? They seem like reasonable people, but they&#8217;re betting the whole farm on their cockeyed ideas about consciousness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Allen recalled experiments from earlier in the century, when they&#8217;d “created a computer-brain” and claimed it was alive. They lined up volunteers, plugged them into the machines, and disconnected them from their own flesh-brains. They ended up with a bunch of corpses.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">A nut is a nut is a nut,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The Free Flow of Information Act, Senate Bill 987, is now under consideration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This misnamed piece of insanity seeks to define who a journalist is and isn&#8217;t, thereby compelling all “non-journalists” to reveal their sources on demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Who would be non-journalists? Millions and millions of people who blog, write online articles, and post videos. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Sorry. No sale, Congress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The bill, which tries to define what a reporter is, is going to be as effective as trying to stop waves from breaking on the beach with your prurient sniffing noses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If politicians can decide whether I&#8217;m a journalist, I can decide whether they&#8217;re representing the people who elected them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If politicians can declare I&#8217;m not a reporter, and therefore I must testify about my sources, I can decide they&#8217;re not representatives, and therefore all their votes on legislation are null and void.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I can also decide Brian Williams, Scott Pelley, and Dianne Sawyer are animated cartoons that read press releases from the White House. Not journalists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I can decide that one of the bill&#8217;s main supporters, gun-toting Senator Dianne Feinstein, who replaced her weapon with armed security guards, is a frog who was hatched in a Superfund site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I can decide the Constitution makes illegal 95% of what the federal government does, merely on the basis of the 10</span><sup><span style="font-size:large;">th</span></sup><span style="font-size:large;"> Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I can decide the NSA is a fake investigative reporter who is sourcing 90% of his stories by spying on the American people&#8212;and therefore must reveal those sources. He must disclose all the names of all the people in America (his sources) on whom he is spying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I can decide Washington DC is a cesspool of poison and must be cordoned off, eliminating entry and exit, and thereby protecting the rest of America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">My freedom does not come from the government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">My freedom to write and speak does not come from politicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Or from the courts.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Feinstein wants to define a reporter as someone who draws a paycheck from a legitimate news organization. I define her as a politician who draws an illegitimate paycheck from the American people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I define mainstream news organizations as cowardly thieves who spend their days deceiving their audiences. These organizations should exist in a giant soap bubble, where they can talk only to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Because news companies are bleeding red ink out of every orifice, they want protection. They want an official legislated monopoly on inventing reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But intrinsically, reality is a matter open to debate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">That fact will never change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">No president, whether he claims to feel our pain, can&#8217;t read a teleprompter, or appears out of a cloud to save the world can alter that fact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here is the truth. Everyone is a reporter. Everyone can seek answers and look for them. This is: the ocean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Now, you politicians, waddle up to it and stick your nosy noses against it and try to stop it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You lose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Your cesspool will go dry before our ocean does.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">Mentally unstable man in the military gains legal access to gun, goes on rampage. That&#8217;s the portrait.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Heavily promoted details: “Should never have been allowed to buy a gun, but prior red-flag arrests weren&#8217;t prosecuted. Slipped through the cracks. Heard voices, claimed he was being assaulted with microwaves that prevented him from sleeping. Obvious nut job. But still, he was able to buy a gun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Bottom line: Do whatever is necessary to grab guns from private citizens. Tighten laws. Step up psychiatric interventions across the land, to prevent shootings before they occur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Perfect. You couldn&#8217;t have scripted a better sales campaign for gun control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And therefore, one can legitimately ask: Did somebody script the word-picture of Alexis for that very purpose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Until official sources retracted the claim that Alexis had an AR-15 at the Navy Yard, it was: James Holmes (Aurora), Adam Lanza (Sandy Hook) and Alexis all supposedly firing the semi-auto weapon. Bottom line: “stop selling the AR-15 and any other semi-auto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">When it comes to characterizing Alexis as mentally unstable, you need to ask yourself this&#8212;if someone was, in fact, deploying available technology to produce the sounds of voices talking to you, and hitting you with microwaves to keep you awake night after night&#8230; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">What could you do to make people believe that story?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;ll tell you what: nothing. You&#8217;d be sunk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Let&#8217;s assume Alexis was already somewhat unstable. That would make him a better candidate for harassment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">At that point, there would be two ways to go, if you wanted to engineer a mass shooting. Make Alexis an innocent patsy. Or actually turn him into a Manchurian Candidate, an MKULTRA subject who would kill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If your objective is gun control, you&#8217;d achieve your aim either way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And here is the bonus: in the wake of the Navy Yard shooting, you could institute more psychiatric control of the citizenry, which means, when you strip away the baloney, more fake mental-disorder diagnoses and more drugs which CAUSE VIOLENT BEHAVIOR, including suicide and homicide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">After which you can make an even better case for universal gun banning, because people on those drugs would be committing murders from coast to coast in greater numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Of course, when television viewers pray at the altar of the major news networks, they would never entertain, for a moment, what I&#8217;m suggesting here. Why not? Because, as consumers, they&#8217;ve allowed themselves to be conditioned, for many years, by the kinds of tales these media outlets tell. If well-known “journalists” don&#8217;t speak of “patsy” or “mind control,” there&#8217;s nothing to know about.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Meanwhile&#8230; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Patsy at the scene? How would that work? Several possibilities. Alexis is there, but another shooter is doing the killing. He kills Alexis, who becomes the focus of the story, the “shooter.” A shotgun and AR-15 are placed near his body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The problem to overcome: witness statements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">So far, I find two witnesses, Terry Durham and Todd Brundige, executive assistants in Building 197, who claim they saw “the shooter” down a long hallway fire a a gun at them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In their television interview, which you can find at YouTube (BBC, other outlets) they claim they couldn&#8217;t see the shooter&#8217;s face. However, the Washington Times reports Durham saying, “I could see his face.” Quite odd, when we have her on camera saying the reverse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Other news outlets use headlines to suggest these two witnesses did see (“confronted,” “came face-to-face with”) the killer&#8217;s face, but the body of text finally confesses this is not the case, despite some slippery language (“came around a corner and saw the killer”).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Obviously, media outlets are trying to make more out of less. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It seems somewhat curious that we don&#8217;t have many witnesses who are specifically making positive IDs of Alexis killing people in the building. For example, in the Aurora Theater shooting, a number of witnesses say they saw the shooter. Of course, he was masked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Well, what about police statements? We&#8217;re told cops killed Alexis in a shootout. How many cops? Unknown. Five, ten, one? I find one report of a canine cop (unnamed) who traded shots with “a gunman” and was seriously wounded in both legs. He was in surgery at the time of the report, and was expected to undergo a number of operations, in an attempt to save his legs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Perhaps there are other witness statements out there which positively ID Alexis as the shooter. I have not found them.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Turning Alexis into an MKULTRA Manchurian Candidate, who would, as a result of mind control, go into the building and kill people is an entirely different matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In that case, the microwave harassment and the broadcast voices would serve as a softening up process. But much more would have to be done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">(I should note here that when Alexis reported the voices and the microwave harassment to the Rhode Island police, he refused to say what the voices were telling him. If his basic story is true, perhaps he was receiving commands and instructions&#8212;although in my opinion such commands (“kill,” “attack,” etc.) would be insufficient to program him specifically.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Although there are patents one could search to try to learn about modern mind control technology, and statements from people who were past victims of mind control, many blank areas remain. This is because the experiments are secret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here is a bit of background on MKULTRA secrecy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Back in the early 1990s, I interviewed John Marks, author of <i>Search for the Manchurian Candidate</i> (1979). This was the book that exposed the existence of the CIA MKULTRA program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Marks related the following to me. He had filed many Freedom of Information (FOIA) requests to the CIA for documents relating to their mind-control program. He got nothing back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Finally, as if to play a joke on him, someone at the CIA sent him 10 boxes of financial and accounting records. The attitude was, “Here, see what you can do with this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;ve seen some of those records. They&#8217;re very boring reading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But Marks went through them, and lo and behold, he found he could piece together MKULTRA projects, based on the funding data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Eventually, he assembled enough information to begin naming names. He conducted interviews. The shape of MKULTRA swam into view. And so he wrote his book, <i>Search for the Manchurian Candidate</i>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He told me that three important books had been written about MKULTRA, and they all, in a sense, stemmed from those 10 boxes of CIA financial records. There was his own book; <i>Operation Mind Control</i> by Walter Bowart; and <i>The Mind Manipulators by</i> Alan Scheflin and Edward Opton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Marks continued to press the CIA for more MKULTRA information. He explained to me what then happened. A CIA official told him the following: in 1962, after ten years of mind-control experiments, the whole MKULTRA program had been shifted over to another internal CIA department, the Office of Research and Development (ORD).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The ORD had a hundred boxes of information on their MKULTRA work, and there was no way under the sun, Marks was told, that he was ever going to get his hands on any of it. It was over. It didn&#8217;t matter how many FOIA requests Marks filed. He was done. The door was shut. Goodbye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The CIA had gone darker than it ever had before. No leaks of any kind would be permitted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In case there is any doubt about it, the idea of relying on the CIA to admit what it has done in the mind-control area, what it is doing, and what it will do should be put to bed by John Mark&#8217;s statements. The CIA always has been, and will continue to be, a rogue agency beyond the reach of the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">To give you just a hint about how far the CIA, the US military, and its allied academics will go in MKULTRA “research,” here are two brief excerpts from a piece I wrote in 1995 about human experiments. My information was based on the three key books I mentioned above, as well as Martin Lee&#8217;s classic, <i>Acid Dreams</i>:</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><i>“Dr. Robert Heath of Tulane University, as early as 1955, working for the Army, gave patients LSD while he had electrodes implanted deep inside their brains.”</i></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><i>“In the mid-1950’s, Paul Hoch, M.D., a man who would become Commissioner of Mental Hygiene for the State of New York, then a laborer in the field for the CIA, gave a ‘pseudoneurotic schizophrenic’ patient mescaline. The patient had a not-unfamiliar heaven-and-hell journey on the compound. But Hoch followed this up with a transorbital leucotomy [aka lobotomy]&#8230; Hoch also gave a patient LSD, and a local anesthetic, and then proceeded to remove pieces of his cerebral cortex, asking at various moments whether the patient’s perceptions were changing.”</i></span></span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Because “more psychiatric treatment” is a prime agenda, pushed after every one of these mass shootings, people need to understand how the history of mind control and psychiatry are interwoven, and how the madmen and murderers within these “professions” are content to use torture in the name of science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">From a naturalnews article by Dr. Peter Breggin (“Never again! The real history of psychiatry”) we get insight into one aspect of that history:</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">[Before World War 2, in America], organized psychiatry had been sterilizing tens of thousands of Americans. For a time in California, you couldn&#8217;t be discharged from a state [mental] hospital unless you were sterilized. In Virginia the retarded were targeted. American advocates of sterilization went to Berlin to help the Nazis plan their sterilization program. These Americans reassured the Germans that they would meet no opposition from America in sterilizing their mentally and physically &#8216;unfit&#8217; citizens.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">While the murder of mental patients was going full swing in Germany, knowledgeable American psychiatrists and neurologists didn&#8217;t want to be left out. In 1942, the American Psychiatric Association held a debate about whether to sterilize or to murder low IQ &#8216;retarded&#8217; children when they reached the age of five. Those were the only two alternatives in the debate: sterilization or death.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">After the debate, the official journal of the American Psychiatric Association published an editorial in which it chose sides in favor of murder (&#8220;Euthanasia&#8221; in the <span style="font-size:large;"><i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i></span><span style="font-size:large;">, 1942, volume 99, pp. 141-143). It said psychiatrists would have to muster their psychological skills to keep parents from feeling guilty about agreeing to have their children killed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Dr. Breggin, in his books, including <i>Toxic Psychiatry</i> and <i>Medication Madness</i>, demonstrates that this “healing profession” is still tilling the same soil. Because of its reach with toxic drugs, it&#8217;s more dangerous and deadly than ever. Only its PR has improved. </span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I obviously can&#8217;t prove or conclude that Aaron Alexis was MKULTRA-programmed. But I can say the CIA and other allied agencies have an extensive track record of carrying out horrendous mind-control experiments, concealing them, concealing the technology, and making bland statements to the public and the press denying their contemporary use of mind-control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If Alexis was, in fact, the man who killed people in the the Navy Yard, and he wasn&#8217;t overtly programmed to do it, then recent accounts strongly suggest he was taking psychiatric drugs. The SSRI antidepressants, in particular, have a long track record of pushing patients over the edge into suicidal and murderous violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Psychiatry IS a form of MKULTRA. It operates according to a different plan, what I call the Johnny Appleseed approach. Drop enough drugs into enough bodies, and then stand back and watch the killings sprout here and there and here and there, across the land. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">by Jon Rappoport</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">September 18, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/">www.nomorefakenews.com</a> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The year was 2054. The artist, living on the edge of the city in a small room, picked up his messages and discovered one from the Bureau of Mind Management. It was an order to appear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In an office on the 15<sup>th</sup> floor of a virtual building, he sat in a chair surrounded by a ring of yellow tulips. A holographic interrogator materialized.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">We have a report on you,” the i-figure said. “It indicates an output difficult to measure or interpret. What can you tell us about this?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Well,” the artist said, “I&#8217;m composing a symphony.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">A symphony? What is that?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s a piece of music written for a large orchestra.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I find no extant orchestras in the country.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">That&#8217;s true,” the artist said. “Nevertheless, I&#8217;m composing.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Why?” the i-figure said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">For that day when an orchestra may come into being.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Your thought impulses entered ranges we were not able to summarize.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I suppose that means your instruments are limited,” the artist said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">There was a pause.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Your statement is incendiary,” the i-figure said. “It suggests we are imposing a restriction. As you well know, the science is settled on this point. We measure and interpret thought that contributes to an overall positive outcome, for the population at large.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m aware of that, yes,” the artist said. “But the science rests on certain assumptions. I would call it greatest good as a lowest common denominator.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What do you mean?” the i-figure said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You assume a certain mindset contributes to the consensus reality you favor. You legislate or permit a range of thought that will produce the consensus.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">That&#8217;s a gross oversimplification.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It doesn&#8217;t describe the algorithms you employ,” the artist said, “but all in all I believe my summary is correct. You&#8217;re reality makers. You monitor thought-emissions, and when you find a departure from &#8216;combined averages,&#8217; as you call them, you issue a citation.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What is this symphony you&#8217;re composing?” the i-figure said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s impossible to explain. It&#8217;s music.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It has a specific message?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">No. If it did, I would write out the message and leave it at that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Pause.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Why have we not heard of you before?” said the i-figure.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Because I was doing illustrations for the Happiness Holos.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What happened?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I became bored. A machine could make those pictures. So I decided to compose music.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">The Happiness Holos are an essential social program.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Perhaps,” the artist said. “They encourage people to stay on the positive side of a fantasy-construct called Positive&amp;Negative, which as you know is a State-sponsored theme. But what is superficially indicated by those two opposing sets is, in fact, fuel for the fire.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Fuel for what fire?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">The creative fire. The artist can use and transform any material.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Where did you hear such a thing?” the i-figure said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Nowhere,” the artist said. “I&#8217;ve experienced it many times.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Your views are highly eccentric,” the i-figure said. “I will have to consult your childhood history to understand their roots.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m afraid that won&#8217;t do you any good.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Why not?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Because your version, the US Department of Psychology version of cause and effect, is propaganda for the masses.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">This is your idea of a joke?” the i-figure said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Not at all.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">When you compose this&#8230;symphony, how do you think?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s not thinking in the way you use the term,” the artist said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">No? Then what do you do?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I invent sound.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Preposterous.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Large masses of sound.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Absurd. According to what underlying pattern?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">None,” the artist said. “I assume you&#8217;re from the The Library of Structures. You won&#8217;t find my activity in the catalogs.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">All structures and patterns are contained in the files.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I doubt that,” the artist said. “But regardless, I don&#8217;t invent through pattern.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">No?” the i-figure said. “How then?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I improvise.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">And this term refers to?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Something done spontaneously,” the artist said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">And you exceed prescribed ranges of thought in the process.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Perhaps. I would hope so. I don&#8217;t keep track.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;re being flippant,” the i-figure said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I knew you&#8217;d cite me,” the artist said. “I&#8217;m just trying to enjoy myself until you pass sentence.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">There is no sentence,” the i-figure said. “You&#8217;re an anomaly. We investigate. We consider. We direct resources. We question. We determine.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m afraid,” the artist said, “that your and my idea of &#8216;determine&#8217; are quite different.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Let me ask you this,” the i-figure said. “When you are composing, do you ever believe you enter into a realm or area that could be called &#8216;non-material&#8217;?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Not if you&#8217;re referring to some fairyland. But all thought is basically non-material. The brain registers it after the fact. Thought, the real thing, doesn&#8217;t take place in the brain.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;re deluded,” the i-figure said. “And disordered.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">If I could simply confess to that and be on my way, I&#8217;d be a happy man. But I&#8217;m sure you have charges to attach.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You live in a society,” the i-figure said. “To keep the peace and maintain the Positive, from which all good things flow, science has discovered that thought should occur within certain parameters.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">If you insist.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">We want to study you. It&#8217;s a great honor to be called. You could help extend the boundaries of research.”</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The artist was about to ask whether he had a choice, when a holographic webbing that looked curiously like a rainbow clamped him tight in his chair. The pressure increased.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">We register some variation from the norm in your present thinking,” the i-figure said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What present thinking?” the artist said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What you&#8217;re thinking right now.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">That was quick.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">The readouts are instantaneous&#8230;what are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The artist took up from where he&#8217;d last left off, composing his symphony.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m starting the third movement,” he said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Wait,” the i-figure said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">His left arm sizzled and disappeared.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">This is the thunderstorm section,” the artist said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The pressure of the rainbow around him relaxed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The virtual building blinked off, on, off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The i-figure said, “What you&#8217;re doing is disruptive.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s because of how you set your frequencies,” the artist said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He continued composing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">All along the major esplanade, and in the lake area, and in the industrial parks and residential high rises, virtual structures shattered like glass. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Then adjoining suburban towns blew away into the sky of the communal apparatus. The i-figure reminded the artist of one of those ancient neon signs, broken, buzzing, blinking. Finally, it went dark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Ten thousand holographic government buildings started to explode, froze, and vanished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The artist said to no one, “I&#8217;m just composing. Well, maybe not just.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He was suddenly back in his room at the edge of the city. But now there was no edge and no city. The room felt like a vehicle traveling through space.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I suppose this is what they mean by a negative consequence,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The room increased velocity and&#8230;jumped. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">by Jon Rappoport</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">September 17, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Yesterday, I referenced a USA Today piece which cited a federal law-enforcement source (off the record), who states that Aaron Alexis, the accused shooter, cleared a Navy Yard security checkpoint in his car. After parking in the lot, he got into an argument and opened fire on one or two people. He then entered the building where he went on a killing spree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">So did Alexis shoot his way past security guards at the building&#8217;s separate checkpoint? Why weren&#8217;t the guards waiting for him just outside the building with their weapons drawn, after he, Alexis, had already shot people in the parking lot?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This USA Today account hasn&#8217;t spread widely through major media. It&#8217;s a version of events quite different from the official, more peaceful “gained entrance to the building by using someone&#8217;s else&#8217;s ID.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">So that&#8217;s two accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Now I have a third, from an unsourced person who appears to be familiar with procedures at the Navy Yard and other naval facilities where computer techs (private contractors) work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">According to this source, Alexis was to show up at the Yard to work. He&#8217;d been hired as a tech. This was his first day on the job. He didn&#8217;t need two IDs, because these private-contractor techs are issued a VAL, Visitor Authorization Letter, which permits them to enter and work in various buildings. These VALs have an expiration date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Alexis would have been carrying a VAL to get past checkpoints. Also, these techs typically carry no more than a backpack or small bag for cables and program CDs. Highly unlikely that Alexis could have gotten inside with a shotgun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">So that&#8217;s three scenarios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Then we have the variations. He obtained an AR15 inside the building. No he didn&#8217;t. He got hold of two handguns. He fired an AR15 shotgun (CNN), which doesn&#8217;t exist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">There were two other shooters. No there weren&#8217;t. One of the two was interviewed and released. The third suspect? Who knows?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Somebody&#8217;s lying, big-time.</span></p>

<p><a title="The Matrix Revealed" href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/the-matrix-revealed-vol-1-mp3s-pdfs-by-jon-rappoport-mega-info/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-2732"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2732" alt="The Matrix Revealed" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/matrixrevealed3.jpg?w=640"   /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Have the networks shown pictures of the actual security checkpoints outside the parking lot and at the building, allowing us to infer what really happened there? If so, I haven&#8217;t seen them. Neither have I seen pictures of the parking lot, where, if pictures were taken early enough, one would expect to find shell casings and blood, assuming the USA Today story is correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The narrative is crumbling. And reporters aren&#8217;t picking up the ball, because they merely take dictation from law-enforcement officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In view of such a miserable excuse for information, assuming Alexis was the killer is speculation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">by Jon Rappoport</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">September 17, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">After covering a number of mass shootings and bombings over the last 20 years, <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/rappoport-replies-to-a-salon-com-charge-that-hes-a-conspiracist/" target="_blank">I question the official explanation when a new one occurs. Automatically. Always. Every single time.</a></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">They lie. They obfuscate. They parrot. They don&#8217;t investigate beyond a comfortable point. They leave loose ends, which are often far more important than the supposed central facts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And there is always a psyop after the event. It goes like this: “tragedy,” “unspeakable,” “will bring to justice,” “our thoughts and prayers are with,” “this didn&#8217;t happen in a war, it happened here,” “vigil for victims,” “grieving,” “closure,” “nation mourns the loss.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Why is this a psyop? Because the government officials and mainstream media reporters don&#8217;t feel what they claim to be feeling. Their “positions as leaders” feel something, which is the same thing as saying it&#8217;s an act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Beyond that, the purpose of the psyop is to divert attention from the fact that law-enforcement officials are bending the investigation, abandoning significant leads, and taking the short path to a “satisfactory” wrap-up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">To boil down the psyop: “it was tragic, and now it&#8217;s solved.” One, two. Open wound, closed wound. That&#8217;s the government/media formula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2013/09/16/breaking-us-navy-yard-shooting-is-it-possible-to-learn-the-truth/" target="_blank">In my previous article</a></span></span>, I mentioned the psychiatric drug connection as a distinct possibility that haunts every one of these crimes. Rarely will reporters bother to look into this. It&#8217;s dicey for them. Exposing pharmaceutical companies and their horrendously toxic drugs is bad for business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Imagine this front-page NY Times headline: “Four leading physicians state that, in all likelihood, the shooter was on one of the SSRI antidepressants, which can and do push people over into violence, including murder.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Sub-head: “The doctors vow to press the authorities until they get to the bottom of the psychiatric-homicide connection.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Sure. That&#8217;s going to happen when a rooster flies a spaceship to the Orion Belt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If the purported shooter at the Navy Yard, Aaron Alexis (where is/are the other shooters?), was suffering from PTSD, as his family apparently claims, was he seeing a psychiatrist? What was the diagnosis? What drugs were prescribed? What effects do these drugs have?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Perfectly reasonable and legit questions.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><a title="The Matrix Revealed" href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/the-matrix-revealed-vol-1-mp3s-pdfs-by-jon-rappoport-mega-info/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-2732"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2732" alt="The Matrix Revealed" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/matrixrevealed3.jpg?w=640"   /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Then we have the drills. In a number of these shootings/bombings, official drills that cover the same kind of event that eventually happens were held at the crime scene. Normal? Or op rehearsals? Desensitization of personnel to the real thing? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It turns out that Navy Citadel Shield security drills were held nationwide, at naval facilities, in February/March of both 2012 and 2013. From dcmilitary.com, Feb. 28, 2013: “&#8230;various training exercises with an emphasis on realism to train personnel. Scenarios included active shooters, mass casualty drills, bomb threats, surveillance, and false credential exercises.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/16/navy-yard-shooting/2819543/" target="_blank">From USA Today, 9/16</a></span></span>: Dave Sarr, an environmental engineer, was walking down a nearby street when he saw people running from the Navy Yard. Sarr had seen an evacuation drill a few days earlier at the Navy Yard. “At first I thought it was another drill,” Sarr said. “Then I saw an officer with his weapon drawn.”</span></p>
<p><a href="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/usa-today-091613.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4581" alt="usa-today-091613" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/usa-today-091613.png?w=640"   /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The same USA article cites a federal law-enforcement source (off the record) who states that Aaron Alexis, the accused shooter, cleared a Navy Yard security checkpoint in his car. After parking in the lot, he got into an argument and opened fire on one or two people. He then entered the building where he went on a killing spree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">So did Alexis shoot his way past security guards at the building&#8217;s separate checkpoint? Why weren&#8217;t the guards waiting for him just outside the building with their weapons drawn, after he, Alexis, had already shot people in the parking lot?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And then, of course, we have the many reports of one or two additional shooters at the Navy Yard. Where is he/they? Authorities now state one of these suspects has been cleared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In Columbine, Aurora, Sandy Hook, there were reports of “extra” shooters. They faded out in the repetitive media reports of horror, shock, and grief, never to be mentioned again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">by Jon Rappoport</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">September 16, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He could hardly believe his new life. It was a like a dream unrolling on a carpet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Yes, there were occasional glitches, and repairs had to be done now and then&#8212;his handler called them “refreshers”&#8212;but things were so very beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In his former life he thought he&#8217;d understood the term “juice,” but he hadn&#8217;t had a clue. Real juice was when doors opened you didn&#8217;t even know were closed. As you strode down hallways to meeting rooms, reality was quickly cast up like stage flats to accommodate your objectives and even your moods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Now, ten years into this second existence, an aide brought him a recording. It was a message from his CIA man. His handler. The accompanying brief note read:</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Congratulations on your tenth anniversary. I want you to listen to what I told you at your lowest point, that night in the lab, at the very beginning of our adventure, just to remind you how far you&#8217;ve come. ONWARD!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The recording would be rather disturbing, but he had to hear it. He needed it for comparison. He needed to understand how the best of all possible worlds could crumble. There were no absolute guarantees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Keep on the straight and narrow. Stay with the agenda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He put in his earpiece, sat back, and took it all in: </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Well, I&#8217;m looking at a sad case sitting in front of me, once a prof at some top Ivy joint, but now a puddle of withering wet flesh in the steam bath of the psyche, the two of us here sitting side by side with towels wrapped around our naked bodies in the heat coming out of the walls and the floor. Listen, Doc, the point is, everything you learned in your forty fifty years was funneling into an artificial personality, get what I mean, and when that blew away in the wind, which yes we had some role in bringing about, you were left with nothing, but don&#8217;t try to come at me with whining and recrimination because I can still save you and this isn&#8217;t over, you&#8217;re useful even in your present demented state, you&#8217;ve got circuits we can deploy, plug into, to broadcast messages out into the general public, and this may not be what you imagined your life was going to be, but it&#8217;s better than than <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/the-journey-of-smartman-to-save-the-world/" target="_blank">the Void</a></span></span>.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">There are hearings coming up on the war, and we can use you there too, to testify about who did what to who and who didn&#8217;t, we&#8217;ll feed you the data, we&#8217;ll install the bricks and you&#8217;ll lay them out on the table for the committee in a convincing way, and we&#8217;ll pay you for that, we&#8217;ll set you up in a nice hotel in DC with some people to take care of you, to watch over you, and you&#8217;ll forget about your problems. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Reporters will come to you for statements and cash will flow, maybe you&#8217;ll even marry one of our models, she&#8217;ll make you feel like a top-flight man of the world, you&#8217;ll be a </span><span style="font-size:large;"><i>bon vivant</i></span><span style="font-size:large;"> after a while as you get used to your new status, you&#8217;ll put yourself back together again, step by step, think of it as rehab, a long rehab after surgery, a new time. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">We&#8217;ll pipe these messages through your brain stem, you won&#8217;t even feel it after a while, it&#8217;ll seem like a warm breeze blowing through your head, trees in the glen, sailboats in the harbor, cafes at sunset, new friends. You&#8217;ll wonder how you ever put up with that university and all those stale domeheads, you&#8217;ll be the simulacrum of a player in our cartoon. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You want to hurt somebody you&#8217;ll be able to do it with impunity, nobody&#8217;ll touch you in the afterglow, we&#8217;ll give you look-ins from our spying machinery, homes, offices, ships at sea, we&#8217;ve got the whole show cordoned off, we&#8217;ve got the power&#8230;Doc, I can rebuild the framework for you, I can run you for public office, I can hook you up to watch missile attacks, we can delete your files and lay in new ones, eradicate every little nasty thing you&#8217;ve ever done, Operation Clean Slate, you&#8217;re bad you&#8217;re good, you&#8217;re whatever you want to be, neurologically speaking, you&#8217;re a high-functioning android, a siphon, but you have to let go of the residuals, dump those tag ends of your former life, you can drive yourself crazy with that stuff, try to imagine what it means to have a government inside a government behind you, working for you. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;ll be a star on the horizon making book on a new century, we can create a whole legend for you, backfill your past&#8230;and now you&#8217;ll show up in the middle of night to handle a client who&#8217;s caught in the middle of an op, bail him out, he&#8217;s grateful to you for the rest of his life, he talks about you to his friends, your name spreads like wildfire, you&#8217;re a fixer, other people want your game, see, it&#8217;s yours, you own it, you make up the rules as you go along, you move mountains, you&#8217;re immune, the sweat that comes out of your pores immediately turns into the news.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;re the king of the hill. As long as you&#8217;re ours.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Yes, he remembered how he felt that night so long ago, desperate, at his wit&#8217;s end. They knew he&#8217;d cheated on his wife, knew he was a fraud as a professor, that he&#8217;d plagiarized other men&#8217;s work, that he&#8217;d blackmailed a colleague to get him to withdraw his name from an application for tenure so HE could sit in that endowed chair instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But at his darkest, his CIA man had offered him hope. And not just hope. Brilliant victory. And the ability to radiate a synthetic aura that matched and called forth the deepest dreams of a corrupt city at the heart of global power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">How they accomplished this supernatural feat he&#8217;d never understand, but they succeeded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Wherever he went now, people, insiders, looked at him with special recognition. They were seeing their own perverse desires realized. He had that magical effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And his CIA man fed him timely and acute information to which few others were privy, so when he spoke of issues and problems and crises, he was already in tomorrow, while others were swimming in yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Now, he turned off the recording and smiled. Yes, this was a life he could never have dreamed of, because he didn&#8217;t know it existed, but here he was, playing it out.</span></p>

<p><a title="The Matrix Revealed" href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/the-matrix-revealed-vol-1-mp3s-pdfs-by-jon-rappoport-mega-info/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-2732"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2732" alt="The Matrix Revealed" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/matrixrevealed3.jpg?w=640"   /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">A man he&#8217;d never seen before strolled into his office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The door closed from the outside. They were alone.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;ve listened to the recording?” he man said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">WHO WAS HE? HOW DID HE GET PAST THE GUARDS?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Suddenly nervous, he said, “Yes. I&#8217;ve listened to it.” </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Then know this. Your handler just died in a car crash on the New Jersey Turnpike. He&#8217;s gone. I&#8217;m your new man. He had, shall we say, a special affection for you. I don&#8217;t. I have new rules.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">DIED? NEW RULES?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The man continued, “We&#8217;re putting you &#8216;on the slide,&#8217; as we say. Your ratings are going to go into sharp decline. Nothing personal. You were up, now you&#8217;re down. You&#8217;ll end up looking battered. Scandals. Reverses. Bad publicity.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">But wait! What have I done? My man is dead?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">A few hours ago, yes. You haven&#8217;t done anything. Listen to me. You have a choice. You can take what&#8217;s going to happen to you personally, or you can roll with the punches. Make it easy on yourself. You&#8217;re not the centerpiece. We have larger issues.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What the hell are you talking about? I&#8217;m a decision maker!”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Sure. It seems that way. But don&#8217;t forget who&#8217;s in charge here. Ten years from now, if you behave yourself, you&#8217;ll have your own foundation. You&#8217;ll win back all your friends. You&#8217;ll still be working for us, but the agenda will shift slightly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The CIA man looked at him. There was no respect in his gaze. He was making an assessment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The President of the United States felt paralyzed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He could already sense his aura slipping away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Without thinking, he blurted out, “</span><span style="font-size:large;"><i>I&#8217;m a drug addict who&#8217;s been cut off!”</i></span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Exactly, Mr. President,” the CIA man said. “That&#8217;s a proper analogy. Begin to wean yourself immediately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Again the President spoke without thinking. “Tell me what you did to me at the beginning! I&#8217;ve never known. How did you make all this happen?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The CIA man nodded, as if other men had asked him the question before.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;d be surprised,” he said. “The technology was only a piece of the equation. You see, it was your need. We found it in you. Your need was great.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The summation hit him like a blow to the belly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He had participated in his own re-invention. The obvious reason was there all along. His craven NEED for what this new life could give him.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">This&#8230;what you&#8217;re describing&#8230;would be very difficult,” the President said. He heard the whining tone in his voice. “I&#8217;d be playing without backup. I&#8217;d be ALONE.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Yes,” the CIA man said. “You&#8217;ll be navigating in the dark, in a boat with a broken engine. It&#8217;s a test of courage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The President was silent for a long time.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>Suppose I choose to expose you,</i></span><span style="font-size:large;">” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The CIA man nodded.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Let me put it this way,” he said. “We plan for contingencies. That one is in our book.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The President felt the room tilt. A woman who looked like his mother walked out of the wall in front of him. She pointed a long finger.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;ll behave, son,” she said. “Or you won&#8217;t get any candy and I&#8217;ll whip you before you go to bed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The President was really an arrested child. He huddled inside himself in his chair and thought about open skies and open roads, and how he had left them behind, a long time ago, and instead had chosen fear as his brother-in-arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here and now, he wanted to say that had been his great mistake, but he couldn&#8217;t bring himself to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He forced himself to smile. He believed his smile was charming.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;ll work with you,” he said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Of course you will,” the CIA man said.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><a title="Exit From the Matrix" href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/exit-from-the-matrix/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3550"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3550" alt="Exit From the Matrix" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/matrix-exit1.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The Oval Office righted itself and the woman who looked like his mother disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The President heard phrases like echoes:</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>Make war when we say war, make peace when we say so.” “There are no lies, only advantages.” “Build what we tell you to and they will love you.” “You&#8217;re the most important man in the world.” </i></span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;re not really from the CIA, are you?” the President said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Well, &#8216;CIA&#8217; is a general term,” the man said. “But no. Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re a deeper organization.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The President felt he might explode.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Who&#8217;s running this goddamn country?” he said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">All you have to know is who&#8217;s running you.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m a front man.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;re a hub cap on the wheel of a car at the back of the parade.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The President felt a yearning to return to his earlier years as a professor. Then, he&#8217;d only been a small-time criminal. Now&#8230;he didn&#8217;t know what he was. Why did his handler have to come in here and interrupt his life? Why couldn&#8217;t they operate at a distance and help him preserve the illusion that he was a leader?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Finally, summoning up the remainder of his energy, the President said, “Look, whoever you are. I&#8217;m an actor. Do you understand? I&#8217;m playing my role. That&#8217;s what you want me for. So don&#8217;t show up like this. It ruins my concentration. I need to do what I do well. Everything is riding on the way I perform. This is my </span><span style="font-size:large;"><i>gift</i></span><span style="font-size:large;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The other man nodded.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Yes,” he said. “I&#8217;ll leave you alone. But stay with your role, as you call it, for the rest of your term. Stay in character. Don&#8217;t rock the boat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The President watched the man morph. It took almost a full minute. What was left was the First Lady. She stood there staring at him.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What did you say, dear?” she said. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Oh&#8230;nothing,” he said. “Nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">She looked at her watch.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">We have to dress for dinner,” she said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Of course,” he said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>Now</i></span><span style="font-size:large;">,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">She took him by the arm. She guided him toward the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">For some reason, he tried to remember the day he married her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He couldn&#8217;t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He tried to remember where he&#8217;d first met her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He couldn&#8217;t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">As if she were reading his mind, she said, “I&#8217;ll always be here. I was always here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He realized it was easier to accept what she was saying then try to untangle what couldn&#8217;t be undone.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m a player,” he said. “I&#8217;ll go with this to the end of line. No one and nothing will budge me. I&#8217;ve got a hundred dollars that says I&#8217;ll outlast you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">She grinned.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;re on,” she said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It doesn&#8217;t matter who or what you are,” he said. “When you&#8217;re gone I&#8217;ll still be here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">As they walked out of the Oval Office, he heard faint music. Somewhere in the White House, a band was rehearsing Hail to the Chief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m the President, he thought. They&#8217;ll never be able to take that from me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">By Jon Rappoport</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">September 16, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;ve covered a number of mass shootings. Assuming the people arrested or killed had anything to do with them, one of the top questions is: was the shooter on psychiatric meds?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The mainstream press doesn&#8217;t push for answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s a vital question. In school shootings, we&#8217;ve learned that the answer is often yes. For example, Eric Harris at Columbine in 1999 was on Luvox, an SSRI antidepressant. These SSRIs are well known for pushing people over the edge into violence; and the manic effects can also motivate them to form grandiose plans for destruction. (See the website <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.ssristories.com/index.php" target="_blank">“SSRI stories”</a></span></span> for documented accounts.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In the last few years, the US Armed Forces have loaded down their personnel with psychiatric meds, which have led to suicides and killings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Typically, at these shootings, pharmaceutical investigators show up to find out whether their drugs are involved, so, if necessary, they can clamp down on “information leaks” and instead divert the conversation to: “he had a mental disorder,” as if that, rather than the drugs, was the key factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Another top question: was it a “random” shooting or was it an intentional op, designed for several purposes: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">implementing a further gun grab from private citizens; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">a lesson in official control&#8212;“obey the instructions of the authorities and shelter in place”; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">inducing generalized fear and demoralization in the population; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">and distracting the public from ongoing scandals/ops&#8212;e.g., Syria, NSA spying, Benghazi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Two tweets may or not be be relevant here:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Scott MacFarlane (@MacFarlaneNews) (NBC 4 I-team reporter, Washington DC&#8212;unless someone has hijacked his twitter account): “Navy ran mass shooting drill in Feb-March at Navy Yard. Part of nationwide &#8216;Citadel shield&#8217; security program.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/macfarlanenews.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4569" alt="macfarlanenews" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/macfarlanenews.png?w=300&#038;h=66" width="300" height="66" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Jonathan Feng (@jonfeng1): “There was one active shooter drill during my time at Navy Yard. I was stuck inside a building while getting lunch. Guess which building.”</span></p>
<p><a href="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/jonathan-feng.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4572" alt="Jonathan Feng tweet" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/jonathan-feng.png?w=300&#038;h=58" width="300" height="58" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Several other tweets (unconfirmed info) claim a drill took place at the Navy Yard several days ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Several mass killings (e.g., Aurora, Boston bombing) took place at the same time as, or close to the time of, official terror drills, suggesting several possibilities&#8212;one being the drills were prepping for an intentional op.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">As navy.mil reports, in March of 2012, not 2013, a Solid Curtain-Citadel Shield exercise took place, “designed to test the service&#8217;s ability to respond to nation-wide threats to its installations, units, personnel and families.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Adm. John C Harvey Jr. stated, “Overall, it was a resounding success&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">How did two or three armed shooters enter the Navy Yard and get past security today? Will the mainstream press do a deep investigation on that? </span></p>
<hr />
<p><a title="The Matrix Revealed" href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/the-matrix-revealed-vol-1-mp3s-pdfs-by-jon-rappoport-mega-info/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-2732"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2732" alt="The Matrix Revealed" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/matrixrevealed3.jpg?w=640"   /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">So far, officials are telling the press that at least 6 people have been killed at the Navy Yard and 10 have been wounded. There are two or three shooters, which suggests some level of planning and coordination. DHS has released a pat statement: “no known connection to terrorism,” which means nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In Washington DC, open or concealed carry of weapons (by private citizens) is illegal. Therefore, aside from armed security guards at the Navy Yard, no civilian workers in the buildings can defend themselves against the shooters. Also, from what I can gather, non-security military personnel working inside the Navy Yard are forbidden from carrying weapons as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">From 1886 to 1964, the US Navy Yard manufactured weapons for the US Navy. According to a Wikipedia article, it was, by the start of WW2, the largest ordnance naval yard in the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m writing this on June 24, 2036. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Right now I have the dubious status of being the most wanted man in America. Number one on the FBI&#8217;s list. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Let them try to find me. I&#8217;m buried deep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You all know the sensational story of Baby Joe and the Serenity Hospital in Tenafly, New Jersey. That is, you know what the press is reporting non-stop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m here to correct the story. I&#8217;m here to talk to all the sleeping citizens in their homes and the bureaucrats and the police and the doctors and the lunatics in Congress and the parents who are taking orders from the State and the reporters who are selling themselves out every day of their lives and following the party line and the teachers who are trying to sound like doctors and the killers at the FDA and the DHS robots&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here is what really happened at the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">On June 1, at three in afternoon, after the mother of Joe had been in labor for an hour or so, the doctor gave her a shot and let her float. Then he delivered Joe, who started crying. A nurse calmed him down. They put Joe on his mother&#8217;s belly and she reached for him and took him in her arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">A new doctor walked into the room and held up a syringe and said he was going to give Joe a shot. The Hepatitis B vaccine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">There was no argument, contrary to what the Times wrote. The mother said, “I only have sex with my husband, and I&#8217;m not an IV drug user.” Those were her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">She said this because the Hepatitis B vaccine is supposed to prevent Hepatitis, which comes through sexual transmission and IV drug use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The doctor said, “It&#8217;s mandatory. Your baby has to have the vaccine. And I can already see he has a problem. His head is lolling a little. His eyes are unfocused.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This was a lie. The baby&#8217;s eyes were closed. His head wasn&#8217;t lolling, it was cradled in his mother&#8217;s arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The mother did not then sit up in bed. She didn&#8217;t threaten a lawsuit. She didn&#8217;t argue. She just said, “No vaccine.” Again, the Times was wrong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The doctor said, “I can&#8217;t release the baby from the hospital until he has the shot. If you won&#8217;t give your permission, I&#8217;ll have to notify Child Services. They&#8217;ll send someone over. You don&#8217;t want that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He stepped over to the mother and bent down and looked at the baby. He said to the mother, “You and the baby are in our care. We have to do what&#8217;s best for both of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">She said, “Joe is mine.” She didn&#8217;t tell the doctor not to touch Joe. The Times misreported that, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The doctor said, “You&#8217;re covered under national insurance. The rules say we decide what&#8217;s best for the baby. If you refuse treatment, you can be deleted from the program. You&#8217;ll be uninsured.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Once more, the mother said, “No vaccine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The doctor said, “I&#8217;ll have to call Child Services, and they&#8217;ll bring the police with them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Now, the mother sat up in bed. She tried to shake off the effects of the pain killer. She said, “The government doesn&#8217;t own my baby.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The doctor said, “No, but we control its medical treatment. You have to go along with this. And if you refuse, then the State does take custody of the baby. Then the State decides everything that happens to the baby.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The mother said, “They can&#8217;t own my boy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">A nurse standing next to the doctor said, “They can. They will. And a judge will back that up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I was standing in the room. That&#8217;s how I know everything that was being said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And I acted on it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I said to the doctor, “Back away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He looked at me. He said to his nurse, “Call security.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">She took out her cell and pressed a button.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The doctor said to me, “You realize this baby has to come to the hospital every three months for the next six years, for checkups? I&#8217;ll be here. If I say he&#8217;s depressed, I&#8217;ll put him on an anti-psychotic, or any drug I choose. If I say he has ADHD, I&#8217;ll give him some kind of amphetamine. I&#8217;m the one who decides.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I walked over to the doctor and grabbed him by the throat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I didn&#8217;t punch him. I didn&#8217;t try to strangle him. I just put him under control for the moment. I said, “Don&#8217;t move.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He didn&#8217;t move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Then I kneed him hard in the groin. He yelled and I let go of his throat. He doubled over and fell on the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">There was a second nurse in the room. She laughed and said, “Damn!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">So this was the situation. The mother was still holding Joe. She was looking at me. Her expression, understandably, was one of shock. The baby was all right. He wasn&#8217;t crying. He was lying with his head on his mother&#8217;s chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The second doctor, who had delivered Joe, backed up against the wall. He was afraid. The nurse who&#8217;d signaled for security bent down to help the doctor who was on the floor. The nurse who laughed stood near the bed and just smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The nurse who was bending down helping the doctor on the floor looked up at me and said, “You&#8217;re going to the psych ward.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">No I&#8217;m not,” I said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;re a terrorist,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I didn&#8217;t bother to reply to that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The nurse who was smiling took a step toward me. She said, “By the time this baby is four years old, he&#8217;s going to have sixty shots. The vaccines have poison in them. Aluminum, mercury, formaldehyde, foreign genes. I&#8217;m not going to do this anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">She didn&#8217;t say, as the Times reported, that she was going to help me get out of the hospital. She didn&#8217;t say, “I&#8217;m a rebel.” I know she&#8217;s in the hospital psyche ward, as I write this. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ve drugged her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Then, before I realized what was happening, the nurse who was helping the doctor on the floor, picked up the syringe, walked over to Joe and injected him with the vaccine. It happened fast. The baby screamed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I walked out of the room. I made it to the elevator before security arrived. I got off in the lobby and was in the street when I heard alarm bells ringing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I caught a taxi and rode a few miles north in the city. Then I took a subway east and&#8230;that&#8217;s all you need to know about my escape route. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The press has reported that Joe died because I attacked him. The mother was taken into “protective custody,” so we won&#8217;t be hearing from her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m now wanted for murder. The press is stating I&#8217;m an investigator for a “militia-style” anti-vaccine group called Stop Injection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">DHS has labeled me a domestic terrorist. If I&#8217;m caught, I could spend the rest of my life in prison. The vice-president of the United States has said I should be shot if I resist arrest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This tells you how hard the government is protecting the pharmaceutical industry. Now that vaccines are mandated for every child by federal law, we&#8217;re a nation under the gun and the needle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The government will do whatever it takes to inject poison into children. They don&#8217;t care about the truth. They&#8217;re covering up the actual rates of injury and death from vaccinations. They&#8217;re labeling these injuries with various disease names.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">They&#8217;re even using tax dollars to fund research into finding the germs that “cause” these diseases, when they know it&#8217;s the vaccines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The sun may be shining where you are, and it may be a beautiful day, but we&#8217;re all living in a concentration camp, where doctors inject poison into every child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If you believe what I&#8217;m saying is true, the government and its media allies will call you a primitive savage or a religious nut. That&#8217;s how they keep the population under control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">There is no way out of this except by active resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I have files with me. Every week or so, I&#8217;ll be releasing portions of them. Evidence that the State has been lying to you about vaccines. Evidence that the human damage and destruction is much, much greater than you imagine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The government has banned many independent reports and books about vaccines and taken them out of circulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I see there are rumors about whether I&#8217;m still in the country or have fled to another nation and secretly applied for political asylum. Let me set the record straight. In this world, as it exists now, no nation would grant me protection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I could steal secrets about US war plans or about surveillance of private citizens or rigged elections, and I&#8217;d be able to live in some distant place and avoid extradition. But when it comes to titanic medical crimes, there is no safe haven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You should visit a kindergarten or elementary school at your earliest convenience. Notice the burgeoning enrollments in special ed units. Many of these children have suffered vaccine damage, as well as the toxic effects of psychiatric drugs and “ordinary” medicines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Even in conventional normal classes, schools have vastly simplified lesson-plans, because the children can&#8217;t handle the usual material. They, too, many of them, are dealing with neurological damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The state-sanctioned daily “periods of silence” for meditation are now longer. This is an attempt to avoid the burden of trying to teach physically compromised children how to read, write, and do arithmetic. The “social interaction studies” are gaining as well. Sitting, talking, sharing&#8212;this postpones the moment when the teacher actually has to embark on substantive instruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Everything possible is being done to prevent an individual child from having to stand on his own merit&#8212;and reveal his educational deficiencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Last year&#8217;s outbreak of pertussis among thousands of children in Indiana? The State suppressed a report revealing upwards of 80% of those children had been vaccinated against pertussis&#8212;the real cause of the outbreak was the vaccine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">A hundred thousand people in Southern India suddenly developed paralysis last summer, as health workers were injected 14 million residents with the Gates-Buffet polio vaccine. This, too, was shut out of the press.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">There is much, much more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I only ask that you examine the information I&#8217;ll be releasing shortly. Then you can make up your own minds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">My files are divided into four sections: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">unpublished drug-company studies that document maiming and death in an extraordinary number of children who were given vaccines in clinical trials;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">company and FDA data analyzing intended and unintended toxic ingredients in several dozen vaccines;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">unpublished government statistics on outbreaks and epidemics caused by vaccines;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">drug-company memos documenting over 50 refusals to carry out studies comparing the health of vaccinated and unvaccinated children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The holocaust is here. It has been here for some time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Now, in June of 2036, the President has just announced he is calling on DHS to make sure mandatory vaccination is enforced to the fullest. This means you&#8217;ll be seeing agents in your cities and towns. In your schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In addition to that, a combined CDC/World Health Organization “crisis group” is moving into 30 major cities to monitor vaccination sites and guarantee they are adequately staffed.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">There remain three questions. How did Joe die in the hospital? How did I obtain all these secret files? Who am I?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I came by the files through a government whistleblower you&#8217;ve never heard of. He was researching this subject for a book on his own. He gave up and passed his work to me. I took it because I wanted to learn the truth and the facts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I have some medical training. I have a license as a physician&#8217;s assistant. I obtained a job at Serenity Hospital so I could investigate reports of extreme vaccine damage there. I belong to no group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The Times articles were correct on one point. Joe&#8217;s body was cremated within two hours of his death. There can only be one reason for that. Hospital officials wanted to avoid a coroner&#8217;s investigation that would show the Hepatitis B vaccine killed him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He was a healthy baby. I was in the room. I saw that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Who are the real terrorists here?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">As a child, I incurred damage as a result of vaccines and medical drugs. You probably did, too, because all Americans are forcibly enrolled in the national health insurance plan at birth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This is a system that extends from cradle to grave. That&#8217;s the whole point. Imagine a long, long line of millions and millions of people trudging through life, receiving 40 or 50 diagnoses of diseases and disorders as they go. With each drug prescription, they develop new symptoms, and these symptoms are then called diseases, requiring more toxic treatments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s controlled life in half-light, and it moves inexorably toward the cemetery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Is a population like this even going to be able to think about the political condition in which they find themselves?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">There was a turning point in the first decade of the 21</span><sup><span style="font-size:large;">st</span></sup><span style="font-size:large;"> century. The Congress, under tremendous pressure, without considering that they were supposed to represent the people, passed into law the skeleton of the present government health insurance plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It was hailed as a humanitarian victory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But people in power knew what it really was. And they didn&#8217;t care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">People above them in the food chain not only knew what it was, they insisted on it. They intended to use this heinous system as an instrument of control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And now, in 2036, here we are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Essentially, the country is on lockdown. We live in a medical police state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s called good science. It&#8217;s called greatest good for the greatest number. It&#8217;s called enlightened democracy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Perhaps you read about the recent death of the oldest serving US Senator, Nancy Reid. One of the architects of the original vote that brought national healthcare into being, she died at a California rest home, when she leaped from the balcony of her 19</span><sup><span style="font-size:large;">th</span></sup><span style="font-size:large;"> floor suite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">For the last years of her life, she was living in a psychotic state, having been driven mad by a cocktail of psychiatric drugs that cause motor brain damage and several rounds of “preventive” chemotherapy, which did, in fact, prevent the cells of her body from reproducing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">One more casualty in the war that never ends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The United States is party to an international treaty that forbids the use of chemical weapons. What I&#8217;m describing in this message&#8230;I wish I could go back into the past and alert the people of, say, 2013, who were watching their government debate a proposed attack on a country called Syria, based on a charge that the president of that country deployed chemical weapons on his people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The debate took place at the time when the US medical system was killing, at minimum, 225,000 Americans every year, like clockwork, with its medicines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">What kind of ignorance and brainwashing did it take, then, to make the people of the United States overlook the fact that this was sustained chemical warfare at home, on themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Legal, praised, heralded chemical warfare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Delivered by needles, by pills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Every hour of every day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">by Jon Rappoport</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">September 13, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">SmartMan, who worked for the US Department of Control, often went into deep meditation during the prescribed afternoon periods, utilizing the prescribed DOJ mantras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It was during one of these meditations that he discovered something that shook him to the core.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He promptly ran out into the street, to get away from the office, and walked up and down the block, to calm himself down, and finally sat in the park across the from the Capitol Building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He opened his Gov124r and began searching through his Major Names file.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He found one, made a coded call, and waited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">An hour later, NoMan appeared to his left and took a seat on a bench, where he opened a brown paper bag and began throwing crumbs on the grass for pigeons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">SmartMan walked over and sat down next to his old CIA friend.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What is it?” NoMan said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I was just meditating,” SmartMan said, “and I found a loophole. Actually, it might be a wormhole, and its implications are devastating.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Devastating to whom?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Us.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What mantra were you using?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Why is that important?” said SmartMan.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Everything is important,” said NoMan.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Number 12, the third modulation of the Hindu corkscrew. I rarely employ it, but today, for some reason, I thought it would yield up results. But nothing like THIS.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">And this is?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">SnartMan took a deep breath and slowly let it out.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">The future is open. That&#8217;s what I saw. THE FUTURE IS OPEN. It has no shape.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">NoMan stopped throwing crumbs on the ground. There were no pigeons anyway. They were all dead.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Open in what specific sense?” he said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Well,” SmartMan said, “the future hasn&#8217;t happened yet. That&#8217;s part one. Part two is, it hasn&#8217;t been created. And part three is, people apparently have the power to create it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">NoMan frowned.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Were these thoughts that occurred to you,” he said, “or images?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Neither,” SmartMan said. “I saw a Void. It was&#8230;huge. Perhaps infinite in size. It was all empty space. It made my skin crawl.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Really.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It was uncontrolled.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You saw no monitors?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">None.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">No surveillance?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">None.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">No corporate outposts?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">No.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">NoMan took out his cell and thumbed through a number of headings.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m not finding anything,” he said. “I see plans for futures, blueprints, psyops, cities that cover whole worlds, but no Void.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">We&#8217;ve overlooked it,” SmartMan said. “People can put things into it. Unanticipated things.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Hmmm&#8230;”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I tried,” SmartMan said, “to get a fix on its location, but I couldn&#8217;t. That didn&#8217;t make sense to me. But then I realized the Void wasn&#8217;t really a place at all. It was potentiality. It was like walking into your kitchen and seeing an H-bomb on the floor.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Potentiality,” NoMan said. “A slippery idea.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Well,” SmartMan said, “it&#8217;s a state of affairs, a condition, a situation that could occur, like a press conference where the President strides to the podium and suddenly says, &#8216;The whole country is a fake reality we built for you.&#8217;” </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">If the Void isn&#8217;t a geo-location, then how do we police it,” NoMan said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Exactly,” SmartMan said. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I mean, how much mind control do we have to exert?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Exactly.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You used the word &#8216;create,&#8217;” NoMan said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Yes,” SmartMan said. “That&#8217;s what the Void may be for. It could be a state of mind before creation.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Creation by whom?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Anyone.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">For example, an individual person?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Yes.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">But,” NoMan said, “we&#8217;re all linked up now. I&#8217;m you and you&#8217;re me, and you and I are everybody, and everybody is everybody else. We&#8217;ve made the connection.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">We thought so,” SmartMan said. “Apparently, we overlooked some key factor. At the very end of my meditation, I saw a world completely asleep. And yet the Void didn&#8217;t go away. It was still there.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You know,” NoMan said, “we might find an answer over at DARPA. They&#8217;re working on a Condition Bomb. It&#8217;s still in the early stages.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What is it?” NoMan said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Well, the mathematics are very complicated, but basically you pick a condition, any condition, feed the description into a computer, and then an algorithm pops up. The algorithm, they say, sniffs out the mass consciousness that is parallel to the condition, and it wipes out that aspect of consciousness. Blows it into smithereens.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">So if we could feed Void into the machine, it might erase it,” SmartMan said. “It might cripple or destroy the capacity to create.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Eliminating the problem before it occurs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">SmartMan sat back. “And we save the world.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m going to guess,” NoMan said, “that when you encountered the Void in your meditation, you also found a great deal of freedom there.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It was worse than that,” SmartMan said. “There wasn&#8217;t any freedom THERE. I felt it in MYSELF.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You mean, despite all your training, you still experienced that&#8230;surge?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It was like a stroke of lightning. For a second, I thought I was having a heart attack.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">This is more serious than I thought,” NoMan said. “We&#8217;re going to need to mount a new propaganda campaign.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Against what?” SmartMan said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Against the Void. Against nothing.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">We could call Nothing a mental disorder,” SmartMan said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Absolutely. But we need something more, too. Propaganda messages. &#8216;God doesn&#8217;t want you messing around with the Void. It&#8217;s the Dark Side. It&#8217;s Satanic.&#8217; And &#8216;There are hideous creatures in the Void, giant spiders that suck you into their maw.&#8217; A whole host of covert messages.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">&#8216;Void is the enemy,&#8217;” SmartMan said. “&#8217;Void is selfish and greedy.&#8217; &#8216;Void is rebellion. If you go there, you&#8217;ll be a rebel, too, and your neighbors will shun you.&#8217; &#8216;Parents who enter Void could have their children taken away by the State.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Good,” NoMan said. “Remember those. We&#8217;ll develop an anti-Void vaccine. And more messages: &#8216;See a Void, say something.&#8217; &#8216;Get help before it&#8217;s too late.&#8217; &#8216;We&#8217;re all in this together but the Void isn&#8217;t.&#8217; We&#8217;ll invent a spy who made off with government secrets about the Void and we&#8217;ll capture him.” </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">We can pick a country and say it&#8217;s used Void on its own people and we have to bomb that country to keep it from happening again.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Colleges will begin propagandizing Void as an old discredited system that stands against progress for humanity. &#8216;The Void is racist.&#8217;”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Starting in kindergarten, we&#8217;ll have kids chanting NO VOID NO VOID.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">NoMan stared at the sky.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I think we can get a handle on this,” he said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">For the sake of the world,” SmartMan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But as he said this, he felt the creeping feeling again. The surge, at the edge of his mind. The taste of the crazy&#8230;freedom-thing. As if he didn&#8217;t care. As if he didn&#8217;t care about anything. As if he was sitting at the prow of a ship on the ocean, and he could go anywhere and nobody could stop him. Half-formed ideas came tumbling out of some dim place and they made his blood pump faster. HE WAS ALIVE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He reached into his pocket for his gun. He was going to kill himself. But the gun wasn&#8217;t there.</span></p>

<p><a title="Exit From the Matrix" href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/exit-from-the-matrix/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3550"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3550" alt="Exit From the Matrix" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/matrix-exit1.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He looked at NoMan, who nodded at him. The whole park began to dissolve. Into white. White light. White sheets. White walls. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">We tracked you from the moment you ran out of your office,” NoMan said. “We knew you were in Void. You&#8217;re at Walter Reed. We&#8217;re treating you. We don&#8217;t want you to die. You&#8217;re important to us. You&#8217;re going to become a prime subject in our anti-Void experiments. We&#8217;re on to Void. We need people who&#8217;ve been there, who&#8217;ve become contaminated. We&#8217;ll save you and use you. For the common good. We&#8217;re Unity, my friend.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">SmartMan lay back against the pillow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He blinked. Now he he saw the immaculate hospital room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He was safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Thank God, he was in the right place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here they knew what they were doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He had lost control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Now he would get it back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He would participate in a great adventure, on behalf of the planet.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Is this going to hurt?” he said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">That&#8217;s not a question we ask, “ NoMan said. “We&#8217;re soldiers. We serve. When our number&#8217;s called, we take whatever comes. It&#8217;s the nature of the calling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">SmartMan heard a machine start up. It made several sounds. A rumble, like a tank. A high-pitched whine. And something else. He tried to place it. It was as if&#8230;a shovel was striking loose earth, as if someone was digging a hole.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Wait a minute,” SmartMan said.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s too late,” NoMan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">SmartMan instinctively reached for that sensation, for the stroke of lightning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">IT WAS THERE, and it suddenly HIT&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And&#8230; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He found himself walking down a country road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">On a summer afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">On his left there was a great open field, and on his right a pine forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He started running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He ran and ran and his muscles loosened and he felt a new high coordination and the sensation was sweet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He kept running&#8230; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And it was sweeter still, as he realized he was running toward something. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He didn&#8217;t know what it was. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But he was going there. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">September 13, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Right now, of course, it&#8217;s the war on Syria. Last month, it was something else. And next month, it&#8217;ll be something else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">We&#8217;re looking at one op after another, one crime after another, one cover-up after another, one threat, one psyop after another. It never ends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">To a significant degree, all these operations are just that, planned moves. And they do concern all of us, because the scope of the operations is vast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">However, on another level, these ops are designed for the purpose of engaging all of us so that we&#8217;ll keep thinking in terms of the group (“all of us”)&#8230;and never think about anything else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If you can tune up the population to keep thinking about the group, the collective, you&#8217;ve got them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Hence, the title of this piece: “What concerns all of us at this time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But what about: what concerns NONE of us at this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">What about that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">What about what doesn&#8217;t even exist at this time?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">What about what has yet to be imagined and created?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Who handles that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">What department do you contact to find out about THAT?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Well, you can consult DARPA or any number of think-tanks or the CIA, but again, these blueprints of the future involve all of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m talking about something else:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">That discredited and stepped-on and discounted faculty of the individual called imagination which, by the way, is not a container holding shielded secrets, but is instead a capability of invention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Everything mind control ever was, is, or will be, is ultimately aimed at producing amnesia about that capability. Therefore, when you bring up the subject of imagination, most people just shake their heads and move on. They are clueless about their own astonishing power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Being ignorant, they are easy marks. They can be cajoled into spending their whole lives thinking about “what concerns us most at this time.”</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">When I put together my two mega-collections, <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/the-matrix-revealed-vol-1-cd-by-jon-rappoport-mega-info/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size:large;"><i>The Matrix Revealed</i></span></a></span></span> and <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/exit-from-the-matrix/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size:large;"><i>Exit From the Matrix</i></span></a></span></span>, I was cognizant of this. But I also knew there were people out there who were looking for something else, something beyond group concerns that could trap them forever&#8212; concerns that build a wall between them and their own creative power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Creative power&#8212;this “little selfish preoccupation,” as it&#8217;s been called&#8212;is the difference between night and day, civilization and chaos, desire fulfilled and victimhood, life-force and walking death, deception and insight, fierce joy and a sinkhole in which the same emotions go around and around and around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The reason behind the reason I write about fraud and crime and conspiracy in public life is: I want to expose how reality is being built for us. How perverse designers are constructing a collective mural of existence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Understanding that, one can begin to see how he can create other realities&#8212;without end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s as if we&#8217;re living in a huge room with no ceiling and yet we&#8217;re behaving as if there is a ceiling 10 feet high. The “10- feet high” is the result of amnesia about our own imaginations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The purpose of the collective is destruction of imagination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But imagination can never be destroyed. All individuals can do is force themselves to stay asleep about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Or decide to wake up. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">by Jon Rappoport</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">September 12, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Guilty! the judge said, and it was over. The charge? Maintaining that his work was his own, that he had done it himself, that he had made the choices and invented the words and imagined the whole thing, whatever it was, the novel, the poem, the play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">What it was, was not on trial. Nothing to do with the message. No, it was all about attribution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Because the great spiritual merger had already taken place. The masses had undergone enlightenment, and the government had seen it&#8212;actually, seen TO it&#8212;and then declared that artists could face jail time for pretending to be what many of them said they were:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Individuals. Inventors. People who did things in their own rooms, privately, out of view, by their own means.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This was now verboten. Because it had been established that the whole human race, no one excepted, was tapping into the very same great consciousness, and whatever was in the world emanated from THAT experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">So the judge had no need to deliberate. It was simple. This artist, whoever he was, and it didn&#8217;t matter who he was, was guilty. He claimed he had created his work. He&#8217;d insisted on it. In fact, he denied the merger, said he was no part of it. He opposed it on several grounds. One, it was a fanciful delusion, and two, even if people were actually melting into one another, he didn&#8217;t have to. He could stay right where he was, in his own room, alone, and he could turn out his work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The sin of pride. The sin of ego. Quite distasteful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The artist was transgressing against the human race. He was by deed, word, and attitude, denying the final ascension to Unified Infinite Consciousness. He was saying no to that, over and over. He was revolting against the truth. He was spitting on the Messengers of Peace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This needed punishment. Society had to censure him, had to deny him the right to turn out new work, unless he righteously admitted he was just a channel for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">For example, an anonymous monk in Albania had recently published a 1000-page work titled, The Whole World Engages in Orgy. He dedicated it to the Great Spirit of Wholeness. He prostrated himself before the Akashic Warehouse From Which Information Proceeds and abluted his body with the symbolic blood of past suffering generations. He confessed openly that no word of his book came from him. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">My subconscious,” he said, “is abiding in the Oversoul, and there it asks for knowledge, and knowledge is granted.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He made a pilgrimage to the Monument of the Eternal Smile at the Arizona Yoga Mat Hotel and Entertainment Complex and fasted for 13 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He titled the introduction to his opus: We&#8217;re All in This Together. He stated in no uncertain terms that we are all little dots in the sea of energy and consciousness, and art is merely an expression of that condition. Nothing more. Ever. “No one person achieves anything,” he wrote. “We must cling to that. Not only as a political fact, but as a spiritual revelation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">He stated, “I ask nothing for my work. I abdicate ownership. I surrender. In the past, I suffered from spiritual constipation, but now I have let go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In his Epilog, Letting Go and Moving On, he praised Bright Day III, our new president, for his work in ushering in legislation confirming the discovery of One World Self.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Just as government consents to new scientific discoveries,” wrote the monk, “it now affirms spiritual ones. The President is the expression of our collective thought, and therefore his election was inevitable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">As the judge in the trial described how the monk was an example of what a real artist should be, the defendant in the case stood up and said, “Your Honor, before you pass sentence on me, I have a question. Will there be boundaries on what people, any people, can do in the privacy of their own homes? Since I&#8217;m going to jail for producing my art, I was just wondering whether other prohibitions will soon follow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The judge nodded.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">As a matter of fact,” he said, “there is pending legislation to outlaw certain kinds of independent research, on the grounds that it takes a person away from the Universal Body. So much of a spiritual and political nature is now settled, unfunded research amounts to meddling with Unity. Why should we allow it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The defendant sat down. He said, “Can I think my own thoughts?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You see,” the judge said, “that&#8217;s your problem. You insist on your contemplations, as if they were private possessions.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">All due respect, Your Honor, but I just like to think.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Why?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It pleases me.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">More than your freedom?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">That&#8217;s a tough choice.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">And apparently one you&#8217;ve already made.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The artist said, “You know, there was a time when a person who used the word &#8216;magic&#8217; as a term of approbation could be excommunicated, even tortured, because he was said to be on the side of the Devil.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Nonsense,” the judge said. “We are all magic, together.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">The artist said, “I deny the right of this court to pass sentence on me.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Obviously,” the judge said. “But your opinion has no effect. I could sentence you to six years&#8217; hard labor in a camp in Alaska. Instead, I&#8217;m going to have you live in a padded cell for two years with a group of artists. You&#8217;ll sort out your problems and basically do what you do. CBS is organizing it as a new reality show. It&#8217;s called When Evolution Fails.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Your Honor,” the artist said, “how can you sentence me when you don&#8217;t really believe I exist as an independent person?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The judge wagged his finger.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Don&#8217;t try to pull that one on me,” he said. “You&#8217;re a piece of energy that has broken off from the whole. That&#8217;s all.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">But how? Through my own choice? If so, I have freedom. And that means I am I.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">No it doesn&#8217;t. Some force ultimately pushed you out of the hive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The artist shook his head.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Review what you&#8217;ve been saying to me, Your Honor. You&#8217;ve been accusing me of willful behavior, immoral choices, and claiming I need to change my behavior.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s a convenient way to speak, nothing more. When we get around to changing the language, and we will, all references to individuals will be eradicated. Eventually, the kind of thing you write will come across as gibberish. No one will understand it. It will drop like dead leaves from a tree.” </span></p>

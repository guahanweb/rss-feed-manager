<p>Okay, enough about me.  Let’s get on to the Sunday Survival Buzz.</p>
<h3>SURVIVAL NEWS &amp; ARTICLES FROM AROUND THE WEB</h3>
<p><a href="http://offgridsurvival.com/disasterpreparednessexperts/" target="_blank">Why Most Disaster Preparedness Experts Have No Clue what the Hell They’re Talking About!:</a> A great article from Rob at Off Grid Survival.</p>
<p><a href="http://prepforshtf.com/what-will-you-do-when-the-toilet-paper-gone/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+PreparingForShtf+%28Preparing+For+SHTF%29#.UhArws7n-Hs" target="_blank">What Will You Do When The Toilet Paper Is Gone?:</a>  To be perfectly honest, I hoard toilet paper. I think it has something to do with my upbringing because we always had an entire cupboard full of TP while I was growing up.  Here are some ideas for you to use if you are ever in a situation and there is no toilet paper.</p>
<p><a href="http://honest-food.net/2013/08/05/how-to-clean-a-frog/">How to Clean a Frog</a>:  If you had to, you could clean and eat a frog.  Like I said, if you had to.  This might be a good article to keep.  Just sayin’.</p>
<p><a title="" href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2013/07/compare-over-the-counter-drugs-for-common-ailments-consumer-reports/index.htm?EXTKEY=NB37NT0H" target="_blank">Comparing OTC Drugs for Common Ailments</a>: I thought this was a pretty good list of OTC drugs to have in our survival first aid kits.  One thing to keep in mind is that if a retailer’s brand has the same active ingredient as the name-brand drugs, you should save some money and go for it!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.commonsensehome.com/easiest-ever-no-canning-required-dill-pickles/" target="_blank">Easiest Ever, No Canning Required Dill Pickles</a>:  This is a great recipe for beginning canners – processing or special equipment is required.  You can even put up one jar at a time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.todaysplans.net/use-unt-digital-farmstead-books.html" target="_blank">Fifty Free Farmstead eBooks</a>: The University of North Texas provides online editions of thousands of United States government sponsored books and documents. Here&#8217;s a small sampling of USDA publications from the 1930s through the 1960s. These old works do not show the latest and best methods, but they are still valuable for ideas</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cookingincastiron.com/files/20080123_slowcooker_to_dutchoven.html" target="_blank">Slow Cooker to Dutch Oven Conversion</a>:  This is the perfect cheat sheet for converting those wonderful crock pot recipes to a Dutch oven.  The conversion is for conventional oven cooking but I don’t see why the conversion wouldn’t work outdoors as well.</p>
<h3>BACKDOOR SURVIVAL READER TIPS<span style="color: #000000;"><img style="margin: 0px;" alt="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 84   Backdoor Survival" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=continmoti-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0942364058" width="1" height="1" border="0" title="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 84   Backdoor Survival" /></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">By now you should know that I read every single email that you send to me.  I don’t have the time to respond to each one – I get over 80 emails a day – but like I said, I do read them.  One thing I do is save up the reader tips for posting  in the Sunday Survival Buzz.  My tip folder runneth over so today I share a bunch of them with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A reminder about the real-life range of two-way radios from “UmbrellaMan”.  </span></p>
<blockquote><p>I hate to disillusion you Gaye, but those Midland (or any other make) two-way radios won&#8217;t give you 36 mile, or anywhere near 36 mile range.  Maybe more like 3.6 miles. Anyway, I&#8217;ve got a couple sets and wouldn&#8217;t be without them, BUT I wouldn&#8217;t tell readers to believe what&#8217;s on the packaging (maybe mountaintop to mountaintop).</p></blockquote>
<p>Have a toothache?  Here is a tip from “Bud”:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am extremely blessed to have a prickly ash tree near me. It is also known as an Indian toothache tree. Peel some bark and place it on affected gums. Numbs the pain until care can be found.</p></blockquote>
<p>From “BJ”:</p>
<blockquote><p>Got a cat. Buy litter in plastic jugs. The 20 pound kind. They are easy to clean out and make great water storage jugs.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Doug” has this tip for using a tree branch as a fishing pole:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would recommend that, if you are using a springy branch for fishing, that you tie the line around the BASE of the branch.  That way, if the branch breaks you still have the chance of landing the fish.  One other thing, I would think long and hard about bartering ammunition unless the person I gave the ammunition to was family.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Perry” has a great tip for some inexpensive night-time lighting.</p>
<blockquote><p>Usually I use nighttime for sleep. No sun, sleep. That&#8217;s easy. Sometimes there are needs for some lighting though.</p>
<p>The thing that works for me is an inexpensive solar yard light &#8212; usually about $1.50 each. I put them in the sun in the AM and bring them inside at night for some illumination around the &#8216;cave&#8217;. If I really need to read something, I can do it with one of these lights. Add a few and we can play a game of checkers or whatever.</p>
<p>They can stand alone if you pop off the part to stick in the dirt. Another thing is to make a simple base with sand in a coffee can or a hole in a piece of wood.</p></blockquote>
<h3>THE FINAL WORD</h3>
<p><img style="float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;" alt="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 84   Backdoor Survival" src="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Sunday-Survival-Buzz.jpg" width="200" height="200" title="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 84   Backdoor Survival" /></p>
<p>A couple of years ago I wrote about the importance of vacations.  Even “stay-vacations” at home are beneficial as long as you can set the chores aside and get some true rest and recreation done.  In my case, the lure of the computer and the internet and of course, writing for Backdoor Survival, gets in the way of my well-intentioned stay-vacations.</p>
<p>However you choose to take a break from daily life, please do – even if it is as simple as a trip to the park or a hike on the local trails.  The LOSTD can wait!</p>
<p>Until, next time, remember to make every day a prep day!</p>

<p>Doctor Joe Alton, who is also known as Dr. Bones, has written a series of articles that not only describe diabetes and its causes and symptoms, but also shares some steps you can take now to prevent getting this affliction in the first place.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Survival Friday: Diabetes and Survival   Backdoor Survival" alt="Survival Friday: Diabetes and Survival   Backdoor Survival" src="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SURVIVAL-MEDICINE-Diabetes.jpg" width="403" height="251" border="0" /></p>
<p>According to Joe:</p>
<blockquote><p>Diabetes is the cause of death or a contributing factor in close to 100,000 deaths each year in the U.S. As many who have type 2 diabetes are unaware of it, there are likely huge numbers of “pre-diabetics” who may begin to have medical issues in the next decade.  This means that millions will be dependent on oral medications like Metformin or insulin injections to stay healthy.  In the event of a true disaster, this translates into big problems when the pharmaceuticals run out.</p></blockquote>
<p>In my view, the prudent thing to do is take steps preventive steps to stay healthy now.  Clearly, preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes is one of those steps.  Dr. Bones suggest the following 9 things you can do now to prevent type 2 diabetes.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>Get to a normal weight</em></li>
<li><em>Change your diet</em></li>
<li><em>Get active</em></li>
<li><em>Quit smoking</em></li>
<li><em>Drink Alcohol in moderation</em></li>
<li><em>Consume Cinnamon</em></li>
<li><em>Drink Tea</em></li>
<li><em>Intake Vitamin D and Calcium</em></li>
<li><em>Eat Barley</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of these suggestions are common sense lifestyle choices that can be adopted by just about anyone.  With Joe’s permission, today I share with you part 3 of his 4 part series on diabetes and survival.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>9 Things You Can Do Now to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
<p><b>Type 2 Diabetes</b> (known in the past as adult-onset or non-insulin dependent diabetes) is usually  the result of your body’s resistance to pancreatic insulin. Insulin is required to move sugar (glucose) into cells; there, it is stored and later used to produce energy for the body.</p>
<p>In type 1 diabetes, there is the failure or death of the pancreatic cells that make insulin.  This causes an absolute deficiency of the hormone.  In type 2, there is insulin produced; your body, however, chooses to resist its effects, resulting in elevated sugar levels (“<strong>hyperglycemia”</strong>).  Over time, hyperglycemia causes damage to various organs, including the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves.</p>
<p>If there is a good example for an epidemic disease, type 2 diabetes would be it. In the U.S., there are 24 million diabetes, the grand majority of which are type 2.  This number should more than double by the year 2050, both in the U.S. and worldwide, afflicting more than half a billion people.</p>
<p>Diabetes is the cause of death or a contributing factor in close to 100,000 deaths each year in the U.S. As many who have type 2 diabetes are unaware of it, there are likely huge numbers of “pre-diabetics” who may begin to have medical issues in the next decade.  This means that millions will be dependent on oral medications like Metformin or insulin injections to stay healthy.  In the event of a true disaster, this translates into big problems when the pharmaceuticals run out.</p>
<p>Given this disturbing trend, we should formulate a plan of action to nip type 2 diabetes in the bud. Unlike type 1 diabetes, type 2 does have a well-known and accepted preventative strategy.  These seek to correct the main risk factors for the disease:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obesity (especially around the waist)</li>
<li>Lack of Exercise</li>
<li>Poor Nutrition</li>
<li>Age older than 45 years</li>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>Elevated bad cholesterol (LDL), low “good” cholesterol (HDL) and high triglycerides (fats in blood)</li>
<li>Smoking</li>
<li>Family history</li>
<li>Genetic factors</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain minority groups such as African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native-Americans seem to have higher risk of diabetes. Although genetics, age, and other uncontrollable factors may play a role in type 2 diabetes, they are less important than aspects relating to lifestyle and behavior. You may not be able to change your age (you can try), but you can change your lifestyle.</p>
<p>If you can follow a few simple recommendations, you can decrease your chances of progressing to type 2 diabetes if you are currently pre-diabetic.  Also, if you have type 2 diabetes currently, you can prevent the long-term damage to organs that it causes. You may be thinking: “Not another doctor telling me to exercise and live right”.</p>
<p>Well, maybe I am; there are studies, however, that back me up. The landmark study called the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) took thousands of people at high risk for type 2 diabetes and placed half of them on a basic diet and exercise program.  Over the next few years, the chances of becoming diabetic were 58% lower in those who lost an average of 10 pounds (5% of body weight) and exercised. These results were not flukes; studies from China and Finland achieved the same results.</p>
<p>Another well-known Study took 85,000 female nurses and followed them over a period of 16 years.  The risk for development of type 2 diabetes was decreased 90% if the nurse in question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Had a normal weight for height and age</li>
<li>Ate a healthy diet</li>
<li>Exercised 30 minutes a day</li>
<li>Didn’t smoke</li>
<li>Drank around 3 alcoholic beverages a week (!)</li>
</ul>
<p>So here are some simple recommendations that can help you prevent the progression of type 2 diabetes:</p>
<p><b>Get to a normal weight.</b>  Obesity is the major cause of type 2 diabetes. You have several times the chance of becoming diabetic if you don’t get to a healthy weight for your height and age.  The risk is even higher if you are morbidly obese.  You don’t have to lose it all at once; even if you just lose 5% of your current weight, you can drop your risk by half.</p>
<p><b>Change your diet. </b>Several adjustments in what you eat can decrease your chances of developing type 2 diabetes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid processed foods. In the Nurse’s Health Study, diets rich in whole grains were found to protect against diabetes; processed foods (white bread, white rice, donuts, etc.) caused an increased risk. Scientists looked at the whole grain consumption of over 160,000 women. they found that women who had 2 or 3 servings of whole grains daily had a 30% less chance of type 2 diabetes that those who ate processed foods.  Drinks like sodas were particularly bad, causing spikes in blood levels of sugar (glucose).  Drink water or unsweetened coffee  and tea instead (in moderation).</li>
<li>Carefully manage the fats in your diet. Polyunsaturated fats found in liquid vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds can help prevent type 2 diabetes. Trans fats, found in many baked goods and fried fast foods, have the opposite effect.</li>
<li>Pick protein sources that improve your ability to avoid type 2 diabetes. There is evidence that red meat (beef and pork) increases your risk, especially if processed (hot dogs, bacon, deli meats).  In the Nurse’s Study, eating 3 ounces of red meat increased the chance of developing type 2 diabetes by 20 per cent.  If the red meat was in a processed form, the risk increased by 50 per cent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Get active.  </b>Getting your muscles moving improves their ability to use insulin and absorb sugar. This causes less pressure on insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.  You don’t have to run a daily marathon to get this effect.  Just a brisk 30 minute walk daily will decrease your chances of developing type 2 diabetes by 30 per cent.</p>
<p><b>Quit smoking.  </b>Surprise!  Not really, I’m sure you know that smoking does bad things to just about every organ that is affected by diabetes. Smokers have a 50 per cent higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes, not to mention heart disease, etc., etc.</p>
<p><b>Drink Alcohol in moderation.</b>  Surprise again, this time for real! Moderate amounts of alcohol (up to a drink a day)  increases insulin’s efficiency  at the cellular level.  If you don’t drink at present, though, don’t start: You get more benefit by eating well, exercising, and maintaining a normal weight.</p>
<p>Although the above recommendations are standard ways to prevent type 2 diabetes, some natural substances may have a specific beneficial effect.  Consider reducing your diabetic risk with:</p>
<p><b>Cinnamon</b>.  Research suggest that regular intake of cinnamon may help reduce levels of blood glucose and cholesterol.</p>
<p><b>Tea. </b>Drinking several cups of tea (or perhaps a lesser amount of coffee) may help prevent some type 2 diabetes.  Green tea was considered superior to black tea for this purpose.</p>
<p><b>Vitamin D and Calcium</b>.  A 2006 study found that daily intake of 800 IU of vitamin D and 1200 mg. of Calcium decreased the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 33 per cent.</p>
<p><b>Barley.</b>  A study published this year suggests that barley may reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, thereby decreasing the risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>There are others, but these are mostly related to treatment as opposed to prevention. In the next part of this series, we’ll explore both conventional and alternative options for diabetes in survival settings.</p>

<h3>The Final Word</h3>
<p>Writing about medical issues – especially when they do not apply specifically to you or your family – is not the most exciting or the most “sexy” thing to share on a preparedness website.  That said, for those willing to take heed of the message of prevention, it is important to bring these issues to the forefront.</p>
<p>I encourage you to visit Joe and his wife Amy’s website at <a href="http://www.doomandbloom.net">www.doomandbloom.net</a> and to read the first the other articles in this series on dealing with diabetes in a survival situation.  Here are the links:</p>

<p><span style="color: #c0504d;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is hand operated washing machine. Like a plunger, it uses a technique of pushing and pulling the water through clothes to clean them well without wearing them out. It uses a minimum of water and less soap due to the agitation motion. Use in a bucket (5-gallon suggested), sink or tub. The best part is that it is only $14.95 at <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=9PGNDhpmhqI&amp;offerid=206969.10000001&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0" target="_blank">Emergency Essentials</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<h3>Before the Disaster – 8 Things You Can Do Now</h3>
<p>1.  Make sure that your pets are current on their vaccinations.  This will not only protect them from the nasties, but will also insure that they will not be turned away from a pet or people shelter.</p>
<p>2.  Keep a copy of your pet’s license, vaccination records and a current photograph in your bug-out-bag, first aid kit, or on the <a title="flash drive" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TS1J18/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=continmoti-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004TS1J18" target="_blank">flash drive</a> that you carry on your person at all times.</p>
<p>3.  Make sure that the ID tags worn on your pet are current and that they include your emergency contact information.</p>
<p>4.  Micro-chip your pet.  A microchip is permanent and will identify your pet if he becomes lost.  The cost is low and virtually all shelters and veterinary clinics can read the information on the chip, greatly increasing the likelihood that you will be reunited.</p>
<p>5.  Invest in a properly-sized pet carrier for each animal.  Your carrier should be large enough for your pet to stand  and turn around and if possible, large enough for some food and water as well.  Be sure that your name, cell phone number and email address are marked on the carrier.  I know this is being redundant, but include another copy of your pet’s vaccination records and the contact information for your veterinarian taped to a bag on the outside of your pet carrier.</p>
<p>6.  Identify possible boarding facilities or shelters for your pet in advance. The possibilities include specialized pet shelters, animal control shelters, veterinary clinics and friends and relatives that live out of harm&#8217;s way. In the unlikely chance that you will need to evacuate and leave your home, you will need to know your options so it is best to do your research now, when you have the luxury of time.</p>
<blockquote><p>Note:  Many emergency shelters cannot accept pets. One thing you can do in advance is identify which motels and hotels in the area you plan to evacuate to will allow pets.  If a hurricane or flood is predicted in your area, consider moving yourself, your family, and your pets out of harms way well in advance of the predicted storm.</p></blockquote>
<p>7.  Find a trusted neighbor and give them a key to your house. Make sure this person is comfortable and familiar with your pets and knows our pet’s whereabouts and habits.  This way they will not have to waste precious time trying to find or catch your pet if you can not make it home during an emergency.  The best way to do this is to make a reciprocal arrangement so you can also keep watch for their pets.</p>
<p>8.  Have a window sign ready to go that includes a picture of your pet and the words “PET INSIDE”.  This will alert emergency personnel to the fact that there is an animal in your home that may need to be rescued.</p>
<h3>During the Disaster</h3>
<p>Bring your pets inside immediately.  Animals have instincts about severe weather changes and will often isolate themselves if they are afraid. Bringing them inside early can stop them from running away. Never leave a pet outside or tied up during a storm.</p>
<p>Be sure to have newspapers or puppy pads on hand for sanitary purposes. If you can, feed the animals moist or canned food so they will need less water to drink.</p>
<p>If you evacuate your home, try not to leave your pets behind. Pets most likely cannot survive on their own; and if by some remote chance they do, you may not be able to find them when you return.</p>
<p>If you have no alternative but to leave your pet at home, there are some precautions you must take, but remember that leaving your pet at home alone can place your animal in great danger!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Confine your pet to a safe area inside &#8212; NEVER leave your pet chained outside! </em></li>
<li><em>Leave them loose inside your home with food and plenty of water.  </em></li>
<li><em>Remove the toilet tank lid, raise the seat and brace the bathroom door open so they can drink. </em></li>
<li><em>Place a large notice in the window or outside your home  in a visible area, advising what pets are in the house and where they are located. (Use the sign you created before the disaster.)</em></li>
<li><em>Provide a phone number where you or a contact can be reached as well as the name and number of your vet.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Animals brought to a pet shelter will be required to have proper identification including, a collar, leash, and a rabies tag.  Be sure to bring with you an ample supply of food and water plus any special instructions and medication. It would not hurt to include a favorite toy or blanket.   And for goodness sake, take steps now to housetrain your pet!</p>
<p>Pet shelters, if available, are typically filled on first come, first served basis.  Be sure to call ahead and determine availability.</p>
<h3>After the Disaster</h3>
<p>Your pet may be disoriented and even aggressive after a major disaster.  Like you, they will be stressed.</p>
<p>Be patient and walk your pet around the premises with a leash on until they become re-oriented to your home &#8211; often familiar scents and landmarks may be altered and pets could easily be confused and become lost.  Also, downed power lines, reptiles brought in with high water and debris can all pose a threat for animals after a disaster.</p>
<p>If your pet is lost and cannot be found after a disaster, contact the local animal control office to find out where lost animals can be recovered.  Bring along a picture of your pet and if you can, assist in the rescue operation.</p>
<h3>The Pet Survival Kit</h3>
<p>You have prepared a survival kit for yourself, now get to it and prepare a kit for your pet as well.  The following suggestions are basics that apply whether you are bugging in or, in the case of an evacuation, bugging out.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Proper identification including vaccination records, photo and micro-chip identification number</em></li>
<li><em>Food – preferably dry kibble if that is what your pet is accustomed to eating</em></li>
<li><em>Bottled water or a source of purified water</em></li>
<li><em>Pet snacks or treats</em></li>
<li><em>Collapsible food bowl </em></li>
<li><em>Pet carrier </em></li>
<li><em>Pet Medications, if needed </em></li>
<li><em>Collar, leash, and if needed, a harness or muzzle </em></li>
<li><em>Chew toys and a favorite blanket </em></li>
<li><em>Pet first aid kit (see suggestions below)</em></li>
<li><em>Puppy pads that can be used if the you are confined indoors</em></li>
<li><em>Baggies for waste cleanup </em></li>
<li><em>Sweater or jacket, especially in cold climates</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Pet First Aid Kit</h3>
<p>The topic of first aid for pets warrants an entire article of its own.  For now, however, I would like to share some suggestions from the American Veterinary Medical Association.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Gauze:  For wrapping wounds or muzzling the injured animal</em></li>
<li><em>Nonstick bandages, towels, or strips of clean cloth:  To control bleeding or protect wounds</em></li>
<li><em>Adhesive tape for bandages: For securing the gauze wrap or bandage.  Do not use human adhesive bandages (such as Band-Aids®) on pets<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>Milk of magnesia or Activated charcoal:  To absorb poison.</em></li>
<li><em>Hydrogen peroxide (3%):  To induce vomiting<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>Digital Thermometer:  To check your pet&#8217;s temperature. Do not insert a thermometer in your pet&#8217;s mouth—the temperature must be taken rectally.  Note:  you will need a &#8220;fever&#8221; thermometer because the temperature scale of regular thermometers doesn&#8217;t go high enough for pets<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>Eye dropper (or large syringe without needle):  To give oral treatments or flush wounds</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>The Final Word</h3>
<p>Those little four legged furry friends we call our pets can easily be at risk when disaster strikes.  We need to do as much as we can, in advance, to insure that these special loved ones make it through the crisis so that you can successfully be united when the emergency passes.</p>
<p>Remember, the single most important thing you can do to protect your pets is to take them with you when you evacuate.  Still need convincing?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Animals left behind in a disaster can easily be injured, lost or killed. </em></li>
<li><em>Animals left inside your home can escape through storm-damaged areas, such as broken windows. </em></li>
<li><em>Animals turned loose to fend for themselves are likely to become victims of exposure, starvation, predators, contaminated food or water, or accidents. </em></li>
<li><em>Leaving dogs tied or chained outside in a disaster is a death sentence.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Your pets deserve better.</p>
<p>Even if you think you may only be gone for a few hours, take your pets. When you leave, you have no way of knowing how long you&#8217;ll be kept out of the area, and you may not be able to go back for your pets until it is too late.  If an evacuation is anticipated.  Don’t wait.  Leave early.  After all, an unnecessary trip is far better than waiting too long to leave safely with your pets.</p>

<p>And so it is with most folks who take family preparedness seriously.  They are always saying “so much to do, not enough time”.  Or “once again, I have had a hectic week working on my preps and getting organized”.  So it is with me this week.  No surprises there.</p>

<p>I thought you might like to take a peek at some of the preps I will be taking with me during my travels.  One new addition is the package of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XXVV6W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004XXVV6W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=continmoti-20">Thyrosafe Potassium Iodide Tabs</a><img style="margin: 0px;" alt="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 83   Backdoor Survival" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=continmoti-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004XXVV6W" width="1" height="1" border="0" title="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 83   Backdoor Survival" /> which, given the situation in Syria, is something every traveler should carry with them.  Not that I expect anything to happen but like other types of insurance, you just never know.  (By the way, there was a lot of price gouging on potassium iodide after Fukushima but prices right now are pretty cheap.)</p>
<p>Missing from the photo is my roll of duct tape which is safely tucked away in my carry-on luggage.</p>
<p>Remember the <a href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/survival-friday-use-bandana-save-day/" target="_blank">article on bandanas</a> that I posted a couple of weeks ago?  My order of a dozen bandanas arrived and I was quite pleased by the vibrancy of the colors and the fact that they shrunk very little after being laundered.  Pretty impressive for the price even though they are made in China.</p>

<p>Okay, enough about me.  Let’s get on to the Sunday Survival Buzz.</p>
<h3>SURVIVAL NEWS &amp; ARTICLES FROM AROUND THE WEB</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/business/survivors-scrapers-why-middle-class-feels-it-just-cant-get-4B11186082" target="_blank">&#8216;Survivors,  Scrapers:&#8217; Why the middle class feels like it just can&#8217;t get ahead</a>:  After years of struggling just to make ends meet, many Americans who describe themselves as middle class say they feel like they are barely hanging on, rather than getting ahead.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.starbucks.com/blog/an-open-letter-from-howard-schultz/1268" target="_blank">An Open Letter from Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks Coffee Company</a>: The issue of firearms and the right to open carry is quite controversial.  Some states allow it and others do not.  Many businesses prohibit open carry even where it is legal.  Whether your are for or against, this article by Howard Schultz puts the onus on individuals in a very polite way and removes Starbucks employees from the role of gun cop.  I think it is very well written and worth a read.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.modernhomesteaders.net/modern-day-homesteader-vacation/" target="_blank">The Modern Day Homesteader Vacation</a>:  How does the modern day homesteader prepare for a vacation?  Let’s just say that it is not as simple as just packing up and leaving.  Now that I think about it, the same applies to a certain blogger I know.  Another good read this week.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shtfblog.com/what-happens-if-tshtf-while-youre-flying-on-a-business-trip/" target="_blank">What Happens If TSHTF While You’re Flying On A Business Trip?:</a> Continuing the the travel theme this week is this article that urges you to have a plan in place before you leave home – just in case the worst happens.  And by the way, the suggestions apply to any trip, not just a business trip.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.prepperideas.com/natural-wound-care/" target="_blank">Natural Wound Care</a>:  There are some good suggestions in this article for alternative remedies that can be used to replace antibiotic creams.  Most of the suggestions use common, everyday household items.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.altheadlines.com/pink-slime-back-in-schools-it-never-actually-left-13251266/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Newsletter20130919&amp;utm_term=NLM51055" target="_blank">Pink Slime Back in Schools It Never Actually Left</a>:  After the PR nightmare of &#8220;pink slime”, consumer wrath caused many fast food companies, restaurants, and grocers to drop it.  Apparently however, schools were not required required to remove this unwanted ingredient from meats using in their cafeterias.</p>
<p><a href="http://survivalsherpa.wordpress.com/2013/08/26/a-diy-survival-sling-shot-with-big-game-capabilities/" target="_blank">A DIY Survival Sling Shot with Big Game Capabilities</a>: Could you survive in the wilderness with only a sling shot as your weapon?  Todd at Survival Sherpa shares his experience along with some great photos.</p>
<h3>BACKDOOR SURVIVAL MAIL BAG AND READER TIPS<span style="color: #000000;"><img style="margin: 0px;" alt="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 83   Backdoor Survival" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=continmoti-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0942364058" width="1" height="1" border="0" title="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 83   Backdoor Survival" /></span></h3>
<p>In Friday’s article I asked readers to share some uncommon uses for common things.  This came in from “Serene”:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently took apart a clothespin and used the two pieces to make a splint for an injured finger.</p></blockquote>
<p>Joel offered the following tip:</p>
<blockquote><p>Speaking of a thirst for knowledge, did you know that you can take college courses for free online? MIT has allowed the use of all course materials on the web.  Here is the link explaining how it works: <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/about/" target="_blank"><strong>MIT Open CourseWare</strong></a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Curtis from <a href="http://www.priproducts.com/preparedness.cfm" target="_blank">Power Research Inc</a>. answered a reader’s question regarding the use of PRI-G or PRI-D with fuel that had been previously treated. (See <a title="" href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/secrets-of-succesful-fuel-storage/" target="_blank"><strong>Secrets of Successful Fuel Storage</strong></a>.)</p>
<p>There is no issue with adding PRI to fuel that has been previously treated.  No need to continue with another product though. Just add one dose of PRI annually and your fuel will remain fresh.</p>
<h3>AND THE WINNER IS</h3>
<p>The winner of the PRI-D giveaway is “Dee”.  Here is how she answered the question <span style="color: #9e1f63;">“<em>What provisions, if any, have you made to store fuel for the long term?”</em></span></p>
<blockquote><p>This is something I haven&#8217;t any information. Not owning a car nor other vehicle, it hasn&#8217;t entered into my plans. Guess it would be me hoofing it along with my dog pulling his cart. At least I&#8217;d be gathering/foraging food as I went so I wouldn&#8217;t have to carry so much.</p>
<p>I still like knowing this info. Might give me a plus for bartering if/when it&#8217;s needed by someone. Thanks so much for this.</p></blockquote>
<h3>NEWS FROM OUR SPONSOR</h3>
<p>I just learned that Backdoor Survival sponsor <a href="http://www.directive21.com/" target="_blank">LPC Survival</a> now has an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;me=A1ZJ0FT1LVYVUP&amp;tag=continmoti-20" target="_blank">Amazon page</a>.  This means that in addition to making purchases directly from the LPC Survival website, you can now purchase your Berkey water filters rand other items directly from  the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;me=A1ZJ0FT1LVYVUP&amp;tag=continmoti-20" target="_blank">LPC Survival Amazon Page</a><strong></strong><img style="margin: 0px;" alt="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 83   Backdoor Survival" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=continmoti-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" title="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 83   Backdoor Survival" />.</p>

<h3>OTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS</h3>
<p>Have I announced this yet?  I think so but just in case, here is what I have been working on.  If all goes well, it will be available in early November.</p>
<p><img style="float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;" alt="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 83   Backdoor Survival" src="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Preppers-Guide-to-Food-Storage-Cover-403.jpg" title="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 83   Backdoor Survival" /></p>
<p>As I reported on Facebook a few days ago, thanks to a reader, I learned that Backdoor Survival was #8 on this list of the <a href="http://thebestpreppersites.com/" target="_blank">Best Prepper Websites</a>.  I am thrilled – thank you so much for coming back to visit time and again and making this happen.  Those that know me personally know that BDS is a labor of love which makes this sort of recognition all the more special.</p>
<p>Today, by the way, is the third anniversary of the Backdoor Survival domain name.  I can hardly believe how quickly the time has gone by.</p>
<h3>THE FINAL WORD</h3>
<p>As Tom Bell said in the Homesteader Vacation article:</p>
<blockquote><p>It does not matter how you vacation just do it. There may come a time where society falls apart and we never get to leave the homestead. Time away is a good time to reboot your own system and get your thoughts and priorities in order. If you keep your vacation simple it will improve your skills and clear your mind. Most of all ENJOY yourself!</p></blockquote>
<p>And so I will.  My house-sitters are in place and my bags are almost packed.  I have a lot of great new articles ready to go and some great new books to read while I put my feet up and try to relax.</p>
<p>Have a great week, everyone.  And remember, until, next time, make every day a prep day!</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #9b00d3;"><span style="color: #800040;"><span style="color: #9b00d3;"><span style="color: #9e1f63;">Enjoy your next adventure through common sense and thoughtful preparation!<br />
</span></span></span></span></em><em><span style="color: #9b00d3;"><span style="color: #800040;"><span style="color: #9b00d3;"><span style="color: #9e1f63;">Gaye</span></span></span></span></em></p>
<p><em>If you have not done so already, please be sure to </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/theSurvivalWoman/"><em>like Backdoor Survival on Facebook</em></a><em> to be updated every time there is an awesome new article, news byte, or link to a free survival, prepping or homesteading book on Amazon.  You can also follow Backdoor Survival on <a href="https://pinterest.com/survivalwoman/">Pinterest</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Spotlight Item:</strong>  There are still a two more days left of purchase the <a href="http://ultimatesurvivalbundle.com/bds" target="_blank"><strong>Ultimate Survival Bundle</strong></a>.  I just learned that every person who makes a purchase will get a bonus of one of those business card sized multi-tools that I am always telling you about.  (If you already purchased the bundle, you will get one too.)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://ultimatesurvivalbundle.com/bds" target="_blank"><strong>Ultimate Survival Bundle</strong></a> is a fabulous offer and includes e-books, videos and more from some of the best preparedness experts out there.  My favorite is “<strong>Making the Best of Basics</strong>” from my friend, James Talmadge Stevens, also known as <a href="http://www.1shoppingcart.com/app/?Clk=4135840" target="_blank">Doctor Prepper</a>.  That eBook alone is worth more than the cost of the bundle.<a href="http://ultimatesurvivalbundle.com/bds" target="_blank"><img style="float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;" alt="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 83   Backdoor Survival" src="http://ultimatesurvivalbundle.com/access/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ultimatesurvivalbundle-468-x-60.png" width="468" height="60" title="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 83   Backdoor Survival" /></a></p>
<p>In addition, it is my understanding that everything in the bundle will fit nicely on an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TS1J18/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=continmoti-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004TS1J18" target="_blank">8GB flash drive</a> with lots of room to spare for copies of your personal documents.</p>
<p>Okay, enough said.  I do earn a small commission from each purchase but even if I did not, it is great deal.</p>

<blockquote><p>My favorite survival food is my regular favorite food &#8211; chocolate! I have tried to store it in as many forms as possible, from Tootsie Rolls in the BOB to cocoa powder for baking!</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be so much about survival as it will be psychological welfare. This is an area of prepping that needs to be addressed by all of us!</p></blockquote>

<h3>AN  ENCORE INTERVIEW WITH GEORGE URE</h3>
<p><strong><span style="color: #666666;">1. Given your background and knowledge, what do you feel are the three most important survival or prepping skills?</span></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>It’s hard to boil down survival and prepping skills to a simple “top 3” or even a top 20. The reason is that the way the events have an unfortunate way of delivering a need for that one damn skill you don’t have.</p>
<p>It’s a lot like going into Lowes when you’re planning to build a house: There’s probably not a tool in there you wouldn’t use if you were really planning a “foundation up” construction project. Even the welding section has items you could use, especially if you are going to tack-weld your reinforcing steel (rebar) before you pour concrete.</p>
<p>So education really has a couple of components to it – and this is whether you’re talking prepping/survival or whether you’re building a house. Of course, it also applies if you’re thinking about putting yourself in hock to buy, and education, too. This is a kind of pet peeve area since jobs are so scarce and student loans can simply bury whole families.</p>
<p>It really comes down to defining what you (Gaye) and I would call in developing software the “Use Case.” This is where programmers and analytical types discuss with the customer exactly what they want to accomplish: What information do they need to see on a screen? How big should that font be? Does the company logo need to be on this screen? When this item is missing, does the system have error trapping and – if yes – how does that work?</p>
<p>Well, designing the perfect set of tools and skills for a yet-to-arrive future is difficult to assess even when everything seems to be going wrong. It’s also why Backdoor Survival and <a title="Urban Survival" href="http://urbansurvival.com/" target="_blank">UrbanSurvival</a> and my <a title="George Ure Peoplenomics" href="http://www.peoplenomics.com" target="_blank">Peoplenomics</a> websites are so “sympatico.”</p>
<p>Backdoor Survival has tons of useful “how to” articles while Urban Survival, in particular, is kind of like a “hot sheet” or “threat list” that gets updated and I try (OK, sometimes none too perfectly) to put the specific threat into words and also a number of skill sets that would be useful.</p>
<p>For example, if there was a lot of coastal earthquake activity (besides the Pacific Ring of Fire and New Zealand) then the skills would include timing routes to higher elevations above tsunami threats. Absent that, is there a boat handy? If there is a boat handy, is it self-righting, self-bailing, and does it have some water, oars, a sail, and so forth?</p>
<p>On the other hand, off at the other extreme of water, do you know how to build a condensation water supply using plastic which works even in drought struck areas?</p>
<p>Well, that’s the damn curse I walk around with in my head all the time and I’d be pleased to share it, but it doesn’t get the problem out of my head: I still have to read the news, figure out how the threats have shifted overnight, and then think through (as well as one can between 4 AM and 6 AM) how any of these changes will impact my choice of places, supplies, tools, food, water, energy, and so forth.</p>
<p>What you’ll see (if you haven’t dozed off yet) is that you really need (above all else) an appreciation for the threats and then a plan to address each.</p>
<p>Which leaves me one more choice, so I’ll take what’s behind Curtain #3: We’ve got Awareness and Response figured out which means the missing piece must be Balance. Given that something will eventual happen geologically to move coast lines or crumble mountains, you still need to keep your daily balance because so many of these threats could arrive in the next one minute or not for 10,000 years.</p>
<p>That’s where Balance matters so much. A balanced person with no skills would be a wasted human. A skilled and watchful person can flip into the nutter category in a blink, and the watcher who is thoughtful might actually need to do something someday and since the list of possible skills is long, there’s a lot of work ahead, right?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="color: #666666;">As an author in the survival and/or prepping niche, what are you personally preparing for?</span></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve preparing for “sand in the Vaseline.”</p>
<p>I’ve just spent several hundred dollars buying some rare books for a research project for <a href="http://www.peoplenomics.com" target="_blank">Peoplenomics.com</a> subscribers which I guess I can let slip out here (since only half the planet will hear about it): I’m working on a new e-book which could be anywhere from a few dozen pages to something really long and involved….you know Tolstoy in length.</p>
<p>Here’s the general idea: As humans have evolved, they have brought “eras” with them. Some of the “eras” which came along – and which were being extensively documented by “those old economists” that were active during the last economic Depression – involved the idea of mechanization as an era. Think of it like their version of “high tech” 100-years ago.</p>
<p>Back then, the places that were not tech included most of today’s third world and so forth. The US (and Germany/Europe) were able to fight their wars pretty much independently. The US had its own energy, thanks to the Rockefellers, for example, while Germany had coal and so on.</p>
<p>So part of what I’m doing is going back and seeing how these people were viewing “progress” of their day. That included a massive public works project, not unlike the massive effort going into CERN these days….the digging of the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>OK, now we fast-forward to the Great Depression and a number of these economists were still in vogue and then they started writing about the Big Change which was going to have to come from the impact of mass manufacturing and the fact that horses and other draft animals became obsolete when the traction motor (which we call the tractor) came along and when cars began to replace horses in a serious way.</p>
<p>Then, like now, there was much hand-wringing and cry-babying about what the future would hold. But in the last Depression, the people who made the most money were those who bought prime land and those who bought stocks when they were pennies on the dollar worth of value.</p>
<p>That’s what I’m planning for: A window when things will be so cheap – from the blood running in the streets (financially speaking) that even an idiot can pick up and make money.</p>
<p>But you need a little bit of dough when we get there, which is why we have pushed so far back from civilization to live on 20 acres of land and to try to “watch quietly” and see what we can figure out. Plus it’s a cheap life when you deliberately “de-consume” a bit and grow some of your own food.</p>
<p>Ultimately I think everyone walks around with a look-up table in their head: If this goes wrong then I will do that. But if this other thing over here goes wrong, then I think I’d react by doing thus-and-so.</p>
<p>It’s really what makes Urban/Peoplenomics and Backdoor such a good fit: We watch the threat board and you focus on how to play things.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I’m all over the place…but the threats change often as heck! And like this was supposed to be a reminder, as I was writing this note to you the power went off here at the ranch. 95-degrees, humid and no power…I ask you, what’s the fun in that? The fun part was Elaine coming over and saying “I see the power’s not off over here…” But the power had gone off in the house…so she was over to get me to call the power company.</p>
<p>A quick spin of the AM radio dial revealed it wasn’t EMP or the end of the world…but yeah, that’s the kind of thing I worry about most: We’ve become a highly electricity dependent society so having a diesel genset and solar power is the area which I’ve concentrated most on and now I’m moving my “big effort” into hydroponics this fall and winter.</p>
<p>Even in the short-term, a lack of water and food can kill, so I want plenty of power for the water well and lots of “reach out and touch” with the <a href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/basics-of-ham-radio/" target="_blank">ham radio gear</a>. And while we’re doing it, air conditioning would be nice. But the freezer which is on emergency power? Well, don’t want to lose calories unless we have to…</p>
<p>(I assume the power will come back on, but here I am, working…)</p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://ultimatesurvivalbundle.com/bds"><strong>Ultimate Survival Bundle</strong></a> is a fabulous offer and includes e-books, videos and more from some of the best preparedness experts out there.  My favorite is “<strong>Making the Best of Basics</strong>” from my friend, James Talmadge Stevens, also known as <a href="http://www.1shoppingcart.com/app/?Clk=4135840">Doctor Prepper</a>.  That eBook alone is worth more than the cost of the bundle.<a href="http://ultimatesurvivalbundle.com/bds" target="_blank"><img style="float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;" alt="Summer Book Festival and Giveaway: An Encore from George Ure   Backdoor Survival" src="http://ultimatesurvivalbundle.com/access/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ultimatesurvivalbundle-468-x-60.png" width="468" height="60" title="Summer Book Festival and Giveaway: An Encore from George Ure   Backdoor Survival" /></a></p>
<p>In addition, it is my understanding that everything in the bundle will fit nicely on an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TS1J18/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=continmoti-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004TS1J18" target="_blank">8GB flash drive</a> with lots of room to spare for copies of your personal documents.</p>

<p>Today, Joe Marshall shares his quest to find innovative, off the wall and out of the box uses for a Frisbee.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Innovation And Adaptation, The Most Practical Of Skills</h3>
<p>Survival is all about preparation, but there are some things that you just can’t prepare for.  If you get caught in a situation that you were just absolutely ill equipped to handle, the only thing that would save you is your innovation and adaptability under stress.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I posted an article on Facebook that posed a question…</p>
<p>If you were in a survival situation and found a Frisbee, how would you use it to your advantage?</p>
<p>I wanted to test you all and see just how creative you could get with something as simple as a plastic Frisbee.  After I posted the question I sat back and watched the comments roll in and I have to say you did not fail to impress me!</p>
<p>In fact, I wanted to share with you a few of the responses.</p>
<p>Here are my favorite uncommon, out of the box uses for a Frisbee.</p>
<p>10. Knock fruits out of trees</p>
<p>9. A weather vane</p>
<p>8. A shooting target</p>
<p>7. A makeshift paddle</p>
<p>6. A plate</p>
<p>5. A plate cover (to keep food warm and the bugs out)</p>
<p>4. Fanning your fire</p>
<p>3. A mirror or reflector when lined with tin foil.</p>
<p>2. “If you catch yourself around feral hippies, you can easily distract them with the Frisbee and make a break for it before any Phish starts playing.” (thanks @nick mackinaw, this one made me laugh!)</p>
<p>1. And my personal favorite is from @Mark Baca who uses it as a hunting tool. Read on:</p>
<p>“I use one for quail and pheasant when they tend to be runners rather than flushers. Once they run I throw it over and past them. They see the Frisbee or the shadow and think it is a raptor (Hawk owl etc. not the dinosaur ….lol) and they stop in place to hide from the “predator” giving me the chance to catch up and try to flush them (if hunting) or just shoot them on the ground.( survival situation).”</p>
<p>(Number 2 on the list actually made me laugh out loud!)</p>
<p>Again, survival is all about thinking on your feet and doing what ever is necessary with whatever you have on hand in order to make the best of a bad situation.</p></blockquote>

<h3>THE FINAL WORD</h3>
<p>One day, while I was on the road heading home in my car, I found myself without a bowl for Tucker The Dog’s food.  I did not have a bowl but I did have a coffee filter.  Thus spawned my article <a href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/coffee-filters-for-survival/" target="_blank"><strong>29 Reasons to Use Coffee Filters for Survival</strong></a>.  Now it seems to be that I could have used a Frisbee as well.</p>
<p>So now I need to ask you something.  Have you ever used an item outside of it’s intended purpose to get something done?</p>
<p align="left"><em><span style="color: #9b00d3;"><span style="color: #800040;"><span style="color: #9b00d3;"><span style="color: #9e1f63;">Enjoy your next adventure through common sense and thoughtful preparation!<br />

<p><strong>Spotlight Item:</strong>  There are still a few more days left of purchase the <a href="http://ultimatesurvivalbundle.com/bds" target="_blank"><strong><span style="color: #9e1f63;">Ultimate Survival Bundle</span></strong></a>.  I just learned that every person who makes a purchase will get a bonus of one of those business card sized multi-tools that I am always telling you about.  (If you already purchased the bundle, you will get one too.)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://ultimatesurvivalbundle.com/bds"><strong>Ultimate Survival Bundle</strong></a> is a fabulous offer and includes e-books, videos and more from some of the best preparedness experts out there.  My favorite is “<strong>Making the Best of Basics</strong>” from my friend, James Talmadge Stevens, also known as <a href="http://www.1shoppingcart.com/app/?Clk=4135840">Doctor Prepper</a>.  That eBook alone is worth more than the cost of the bundle.<a href="http://ultimatesurvivalbundle.com/bds" target="_blank"><img style="float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;" alt="Survival Friday: 10 Ways to Use a Frisbee for Survival   Backdoor Survival" src="http://ultimatesurvivalbundle.com/access/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ultimatesurvivalbundle-468-x-60.png" width="468" height="60" title="Survival Friday: 10 Ways to Use a Frisbee for Survival   Backdoor Survival" /></a></p>
<p>In addition, it is my understanding that everything in the bundle will fit nicely on an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TS1J18/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=continmoti-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004TS1J18" target="_blank">8GB flash drive</a> with lots of room to spare for copies of your personal documents.</p>
<p>Okay, enough said.  I do earn a small commission from each purchase but even if I did not, it is great deal.</p>

<p>Today I share with you 12 things people commonly do to roll out the welcome mat to invite the bad guys to pay them a visit.  I also offer some suggestions of things you can do now to make your home less attractive to these uninvited visitors.</p>
<h3>Is Your Home a Target for the Bad Guys?</h3>
<h4><strong>1.</strong>  <strong>Leaving the doors and windows unlocked while you are home inside.</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>You would be surprised at how many folks dutifully lock up when they are away but leave their doors and windows wide open and unattended when they are home.  When I first moved to my current location, strangers would simply walk up to my house and walk right in – supposedly curious to see what it looked like from the inside.</p>
<p>I now leave both the front and back doors locked so that all that these unwelcome visitors get is a rattling door knob and the barking wrath of Tucker the Dog.</p></blockquote>
<h4>2.  <span style="color: #4d4d4d;">Hiding a key under the mat, over the door frame, in a barbecue or some other place that every crook  in the county knows about.</span></h4>
<blockquote><p>This is something else that smart people do,  They hide a key in the most obvious place they can think of – probably so they will not forget themselves.  The problem with this is that everyone else knows about these hidey holes as well.  Fake rock with a well built in for a key?  Jeesh – everyone knows about those.  Instead, invest in a secure key safe such as this one that is mounted outside my back door.</p>

</blockquote>
<h4>3.  Using Facebook, Twitter or other social media sites to advertise your whereabouts.</h4>
<blockquote><p>Many Facebook and Twitter aficionados post their every movement on these and other social networks.  Going to the mall?  It is on Facebook.  Going to a movie?  It is on Twitter.</p>
<p>Believe it. The thieves are watching.  It is not too difficult to become a friend or a friend of a friend and before you know it, your security is compromised because the world knows you are not at home.  The solution? Stop broadcasting your whereabouts except on a need to know basis.</p></blockquote>
<h4>4.  Showing off all the good stuff in your house by leaving packaging and empty boxes from your new electronic toys outside at the curb.</h4>
<blockquote><p>Say a burglar is scoping the neighborhood looking for target.  He sees that big empty box at the curb.  You know – the one your new 50” flat screen came in.  You can bet that this guy is going to case your place, waiting until you are away to come on in and help himself.  Now that 50” flat screen may be too big for him to cart away but if you have that flat screen TV, his assumption is that you are going to have a lot more goodies.</p>
<p>Moral of the story?  Don’t advertise that you have expensive new stuff.</p>
<p>Bonus:  Many online vendors, including <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=9PGNDhpmhqI&amp;offerid=206969.10000001&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0" target="_blank">Emergency Essentials</a>, will ship your order in a plain, unmarked box. All you need to do is ask.</p></blockquote>
<h4>5.  Keeping the place in the dark.</h4>
<blockquote><p>For a few cents a day, you can invest in some economical lighting for your outside area.  The newer light bulbs last forever and can brighten up a porch or yard, deterring not only the prowlers but the four legged critters as well.  You can put the lights on dawn to dusk timers making the lighting a set it and forget it operation.  Personally, a well-lit home is more important than a new outfit or some other trinket.  And that – in a nutshell – says a lot.</p>

</blockquote>
<h4 align="left">6.  Putting up signs indicating your home has a silent alarm, whether true or not.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Let’s get real.  The silent alarm goes off and how long does it take for the cops or the sheriff’s deputies to arrive?  Ten minutes, twenty?  As a former city dweller, I had one of those high-end monitored alarm systems.  That was okay and offered a bit of comfort but in looking back, just how useful was that silent alarm?  When the silent alarm went off, so did a very loud alarm – one so loud that it would wake up the neighbors.</p>
<p align="left">These days I have the loud alarm, my dog, and a shotgun.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 align="left">7.  Going on vacation without stopping the mail or the daily delivery of the newspaper.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">While you are gone, stop the mail, stop the papers, and have a trusted family member or neighbor know you are gone.  Better yet, do what I do and have someone stay in your home and house-sit.  If you live in a planned community, let the security people know you will be gone.</p>
<p align="left">One other thing:  hold off on posting those vacation pictures online until you are back at home.  Why advertise that your house is empty, tempting the burglar to drop on by?</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 align="left">8.  Leaving the garage door open or unlocked.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">This is so easy to do, especially if you have a detached garage like I do.  You are running in and out many times a day and it is a pain in the neck to keep unlocking the door then locking it up again.  The problem is two fold:  first, with the door wide open, passersby (and this includes thieves looking for their next target) can see your stuff.  All your tools, your sporting goods, your stored canned goods and your garden equipment can look awfully attractive to someone who covets those things.</p>
<p align="left">It make take a few extra minutes to close the door and lock things up, but that is exactly what you should do.  And while you are at it, how about some curtains or mini-blinds for those garage windows?</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 align="left">9.  Crappy locks are good as no locks at all.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">The bad guys will simply bypass your home if it requires too much effort or requires more skill and tools to get in than they possess. Invest in quality dead bolt locks with at least a one inch throw.  Also double check the throw plate since most are pretty flimsy.  Upgrade to a four-screw, heavy-duty, high security strike plate which should be available in any hardware store.</p>
<p align="left">If you have a sliding glass door, get an inexpensive wooden dowel to fit insider the railing or track.  This will deter the door from moving, even if the latch has been compromised. while you are gone.</p>
<p align="left">And, once again, let me remind you that for your own safety, lock those doors!</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 align="left">10.  Leaving cash, jewelry and other precious items out in the open for everyone to see.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Consider a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RL9RUO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002RL9RUO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=continmoti-20" target="_blank">home safe</a>.  Home safes are coming down in price and are a wise choice for keeping cash, jewelry, precious metals or guns from inquisitive children, snooping babysitters, and of course, the smash and grab burglar.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>11.  The yards a mess, the bushes are overgrown, and the hedge keeps things nice an private.</h4>
<blockquote><p>Your yard may be shouting out an invitation:  come hide here where no one will see you.  The burglars and thieves don’t want to be seen so what better choice than to find a yard full of clutter where they will blend right in with the chaos.  Or, even better, how about a yard full of over grown bushes that make sneaky hiding places?  Or trees that have thick, sturdy branches that reach out to second story windows and the roof?</p>
<p>Now is the time to get out those clippers and trash bags so that you can clean out the excess brush – and the junk – making it more difficult for the thieves to hide in plain sight, right outside your front door.</p></blockquote>
<h4>12.  Your neighbors are grouchy, too old, too young, too persnickety or ???</h4>
<blockquote><p>Whatever feelings you have about your neighbors, find at least one that you can trust and be a good neighbor.  <a href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/9-simple-ways-for-preppers-to-be-a-good-neighbor/" target="_blank">Good neighbors</a> will look out for each other.  If you can, get to know your neighbors on each side of your home and at least one neighbor directly across the street.  Invite them into your home, communicate often, and establish trust.  Good neighbors will watch out for your home or apartment when you are away and they can report suspicious activity to the police or directly to you while you are away.</p>
<p>The important thing here is to get to know your neighbors and learn whether you can trust them now, before you head out for an extended vacation.  (See <a title="" href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/9-simple-ways-for-preppers-to-be-a-good-neighbor/" target="_blank"><strong>9 Simple Ways for Preppers to Be a Good Neighbor</strong></a>.)</p></blockquote>
<h3>The Final Word</h3>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">When it comes to security, it is easy to focus on security after the disaster or after the collapse, when thugs and looters are running rampant and desperate to take whatever they can from others.  Doesn’t it make good sense, however, to include present day home security as part of your preps?</span></span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CER1BA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000CER1BA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=continmoti-20" target="_blank">Kidde Access Point Key Safe:</a>  This key safe is similar to mine and holds five keys. The best thing about it is that I am always losing my house key in the woods or on the trails and this allows me to get back inside. (And, so far so good, I always go back on find my key which is on a brightly colored flex bracelet so it is easy to spot.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NJDRDA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gaye-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B000NJDRDA" target="_blank">Keypad Deadbolt</a><img style="margin: 0px;" alt="Survival Basics: 12 Things You Can Do Now to Stop the Bad Guys   Backdoor Survival" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gaye-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000NJDRDA&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369" width="1" height="1" border="0" title="Survival Basics: 12 Things You Can Do Now to Stop the Bad Guys   Backdoor Survival" />: Here is another good security option,. With this, you will never have to worry about locking yourself out plus, you can secure the deadbolt from inside the house.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RWKFFY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gaye-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002RWKFFY" target="_blank">Dorcy LED Wireless Motion Sensor Flood Lite</a>: This light is awesome. I use mine downstairs and on my stairwell.  When I get up in the middle of the night, the lights come on automatically. It is quite unobtrusive (I own two in black) and gives off a ton of light. Runs for a year on 3 D size batteries. About $20.</p>

This is the model I own and in addition to the items above, it holds my laptop and other electronics.  I like the size – it was easy to bolt down and of course, to hide among my other belongings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615497551/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=continmoti-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0615497551" target="_blank">Holding Your Ground: Preparing for Defense if it All Falls Apart</a>: This is a really good book from Joe Nobody – a book you should read if you care about defending your homestead.</p>

Offering extremely practical protection, SABRE provides distance from your threat with its 30 foot range. I like that it includes a wall mount. For a more economical solution, visit your local hardware store and stock up on wasp spray.  Very effective.</p>

<h3>10 Traits of the Successful Prepper</h3>
<h4>1.  Have the Will to Live</h4>
<blockquote><p>Prepper’s approach long term survival with gusto.  As busy as they might be with job and family obligations, they are laser focused on insuring that they will be safe for the long term.  They want to live and want to enjoy the bounty of life itself.  To that end, they are prepared to endure hardships and are prepared to defend what is theirs.  They want to live, no matter what, and want to be a productive member of society.</p></blockquote>
<h4>2.  Thirst for Knowledge</h4>
<blockquote><p>There is always something new to learn and to keep the Preppers brain engaged.  There is never a time when they say “enough”.  As difficult as it may be at times to grasp the truth, Preppers seek knowledge and truth and relentlessly pursue just one more skill and one more fact that will help them prevail if their world goes to heck.</p></blockquote>
<h4>3.  Believe in Family Values</h4>
<blockquote><p>The family as a social unit is important – whether it is a family of two or a family of twenty.  Preppers know that and embrace and protect the family unit because it provides a sense of belonging is well as an environment for honesty and respect.  However the family unit is defined (and each of us may define “family” in different terms), the core ideals remain the same: responsibility, accountability and love.</p></blockquote>
<h4>4.  Possess the MacGyver Instinct</h4>
<blockquote><p>Every Prepper is a handyman.  We fix stuff.  We make things work by cobbling together odd bits and pieces into something newly purposed.  We throw away nothing, lest it have some useful purpose down the road.  We strive to jerry-rig our way out of just about anything sometimes with only some <a href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/uses-of-paracord-for-survival/" target="_blank">paracord</a> and <a href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/duct-tape-for-survival/" target="_blank">duct tape</a>.  The words “I can’t make it work” do not exist in the Prepper’s vocabulary.</p></blockquote>
<h4>5.  Have Compassion for Others</h4>
<blockquote><p>Wikipedia defines compassion as “the emotion that we feel in response to the suffering of others that motivates a desire to help”. The so-called survivalists of old were stereotyped as loners.  These days, most Preppers understand the value of being around others and feel a strong emotional connection to helping those that are unable to help themselves.</p>
<p>This is not to say that we as a group are a bunch of bleeding hearts that will give away our hard-earned preps to anyone who comes asking.  Quite the contrary.  What it does mean is that we show compassion for those that are disabled, elderly, ill or simply lack the financial means to do more than a modicum of preparations.  From these individuals we will seek knowledge and skills rather than physical possessions.</p></blockquote>
<h4>6.  Stay Physically and Mentally Fit</h4>
<blockquote><p>To stay on top of the game, we must be able to move around freely and in an unencumbered manner.  This means we must get regular exercise now so that we will be physically fit if we ever have to face an evacuation of bug-out situation.  We must also stay nimble of mind so that rational decisions can be made quickly under the most adverse of circumstances.</p>
<p>Most Prepper’s know this and work toward a goal of physical and mental fitness each and every day of their lives.</p></blockquote>
<h4>7.  Are Critical Thinkers</h4>
<blockquote><p>Critical thinking is the ability to think clearly and rationally. For some this comes naturally, but for most, this is an acquired skill that is honed by the thoughtful examination of risks and rewards before coming to a logical and decisive solution to a problem.  By considering various catastrophic scenarios in advance, Prepper’s make plans for dealing with the risks most inherent to their geographical location and personal circumstances.</p></blockquote>
<h4>8.  Know How to Drive a Hard Bargain</h4>
<blockquote><p>With very few exceptions, the Preppers I know live within the confines of a budget.  In addition to funding their daily life and daily activities, they must fund the acquisition of supplies, outdoor gear, water storage facilities and extra food.  They do this by shopping for bargains, searching for used items at thrift stores and garage sales, and by trading those items they no longer need for items they do.</p>
<p>They practice the skill of bartering services for goods and goods for services.  By doing so, they are able to acquire what they need not only for now, but for long term survival.</p></blockquote>
<h4>9.  Understand the Value of Networking</h4>
<blockquote><p>Preppers understand that not everyone knows everything and not everyone has every single skill they will need to prevail.  For that reason, they surround themselves with other forward thinking and like minded individuals.  Some of these individuals may be local and others may only be accessible virtually over the internet.</p>
<p>Regardless of where they are located, the vast majority of Preppers seek others in a respectful and open-minded manner.  They know that when the going gets tough, they will have someone to share with and together they will watch each other’s backs.</p></blockquote>
<h4>10.  Have Faith</h4>
<blockquote><p>Having faith and having optimism go hand in hand.  Whether that faith is tied to organized religion or not, it is there none the less.  Coupled with the will to live, having faith is what keeps us going.  It allows us to put one foot in front of the other and to keep moving forward, one baby step at a time.  Some will pray while others will quietly reflect in their own manner.</p>
<p>Faith is important and most if not all Prepper’s have faith.</p></blockquote>
<h3>The Final Word</h3>
<p>It took me awhile to come up with this list.  I pondered the top traits of the Preppers I know while taking a quiet hike along the trails near where I live.  I thought about the hundreds if not thousands of emails I have received these past few years and boiled down the experiences that have been shared with me into these ten things that Preppers simply get right.</p>
<p>Chances are that you possess a majority of these traits.  In fact, you may claim ownership of these traits and not even know it.  Today I would like to challenge you to look at this list and to evaluate your own top Prepper traits.  Celebrate those that you have and work on those that may need work.  At the end of the day, if the world goes to heck, you will find that having these traits will allow you to prevail if not in comfort, than in safety.</p>
<p>I invite you to share any traits I may have missed in the comments area below.  And blessings to all of you in your pursuit of preparedness.</p>

<p>The selection includes Apple Dices, Bananas, Peaches, Pineapple Dices, Blueberries and Strawberries.</p>

<p>Long story short, since I was using hotel soaps that I got for free during my travels, I thought no big loss, I can dump it all out and start over if it does not work out.  I let it cool overnight and the next morning I had a blob.  There is no other way to explain it.  It was as thick as peanut butter &#8211; maybe thicker.</p>

<p>I got out my old rotary hand mixer to see if I could fluff it up a bit.  (This hand mixer belonged to the Survival Husband’s mother so it is very old – probably from the 30s.)  I didn’t want to waste any essential oils in case it did not work out so I left it unscented.  It is now four days later and my latest batch of soft soap is still nice and fluffy in its pump dispenser and I am pleased. This is the best batch yet!</p>

<p>As soon as I get back from my vacation I will have to write up a new set of instructions for everyone but in the meantime, you can still adapt the original recipe here at <a href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/how-to-make-dirt-cheap-soft-soap/" target="_blank"><strong>DIY Cleaning: Dirt Cheap Soft Soap</strong></a> to allow for simmering the soapy brew.</p>
<p>Another project this week – and something everyone should do from time to time – was a reassessment of the items in my <a href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/back-to-basics-bug-out-bag/" target="_blank">bug-out-bag</a>.  I added some new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004S4EARI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004S4EARI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=continmoti-20" target="_blank">BIC lighters</a> and some additional <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001949TKS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=continmoti-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001949TKS" target="_blank">water purification tabs</a> and thought about some additional changes as well.</p>
<p>I have a lot more to say about bug-out-bags – new thoughts, actually.  More and more I am focusing on bugging in and not bugging out with my B.O.B. consisting of items I would need only under a forced evacuation.  You can bet that I will have more to say about that in coming months.</p>
<p>Okay, enough about me.  Let’s get on to the Sunday Survival Buzz.</p>
<h3>SURVIVAL NEWS &amp; ARTICLES FROM AROUND THE WEB</h3>
<p><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/they-denied-that-we-were-in-a-depression-in-1933-and-they-are-doing-it-again-in-2013" target="_blank">They Denied That We Were In A Depression In 1933 And They Are Doing It Again In 2013</a>:  The first part of this article starts out:</p>
<blockquote><p>“<em>The more things change, the more things stay the same.  The Great Depression actually started in 1929, but as you will see below, as late as 1933 the Associated Press was still pumping out lots of news stories with optimistic economic headlines and many Americans still did not believe that we were actually in a depression.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://kplu.org/post/study-says-americas-income-gap-widest-great-depression" target="_blank">Study Says America&#8217;s Income Gap Widest Since Great Depression</a>:  And here is a related article fro NPR.</p>
<p><a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/awesome-letter-that-a-dying-military-veteran-sent-to-his-representatives-in-congress" target="_blank">Awesome Letter That A Dying Military Veteran Sent To His Representatives In Congress</a>: You will be amazed by the things that a dying military veteran wrote in a letter to the two U.S. Senators that are representing his state.  Michael Snyder nails it again this week.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freshbitesdaily.com/tomato-pruning-tip/" target="_blank">Late Summer Tomato Pruning — Tip to Maximize Fall Yield</a>:  Folks over on my Facebook page have asked for pruning tips.  This one is excellent.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/opinion/our-coming-food-crisis.html?smid=pl-share&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">Our Coming Food Crisis</a>:  From the NY Times no less.  A quote: “. . . we need to reduce the bureaucratic hurdles to using small- and medium-scale rainwater harvesting and gray water (that is, waste water excluding toilet water) on private lands, rather than funneling all runoff to huge, costly and vulnerable reservoirs behind downstream dams.”  More of the same in this well written op-ed piece.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/09/pearl-harbor-was-also-just-a-limited-air-strike-with-no-boots-on-the-ground.html" target="_blank">Pearl Harbor Was Also Just a Limited Air Strike with No Boots on the Ground</a>: I know I am preaching the choir, but still.</p>
<p><a href="http://consumerreports.org/cro/2013/08/credit-card-skimming-at-gas-pumps/index.htm?EXTKEY=NW0N01309" target="_blank">Don&#8217;t get ripped off by credit card skimming at gas pumps</a>:  Years ago, we were a victim of card-skimming at the pump.  Here are some tips for cutting your risk by learning what not to do when you fill up.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/09/11/colorado-state-senator-who-led-gun-control-push-finds-out-what-can-happen-when-fed-up-voters-take-a-stand/" target="_blank">Two Colorado State Senators Who Led Gun Control Push Find Out What Can Happen When Fed-Up Voters Take a Stand</a>:  Bottom line?  They were fired.  Not only that, “the recall election was apparently triggered by six “regular guys” who were fed-up with lawmakers ramming gun control laws down the throats of voters and ignoring the Second Amendment.  It proves beyond a reasonable doubt that a small group of people, or even just one person, can truly make a difference if they take a stand.”  (A hat tip to Shelly aka the Survival Husband for this one.)</p>
<p><a title="" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2013/09/08/left-with-nothing/" target="_blank">Left With Nothing</a>:  A man in Washington DC owed $134 in property taxes. The District sold the lien to an investor who foreclosed on his $197,000 house and sold it.  He was basically thrown out on the street over $134. This is the original article from the Washington Post and like much I am sharing today, downright maddening.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/09/10-signs-global-elite-are-losing-control.html" target="_blank">10 Signs The Global Elite Are Losing Control</a>:  Here is #1:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Official lies no longer effective: The lies they tell simply don&#8217;t work anymore. There was a time when official lies, especially about war and peace, were believed. Because, after all, how evil would it be to lie about such things? Generally people want to believe they are being told the truth when life and death is at stake. The boy who cried wolf has cried one too many times. Even if they told the truth at this point, very few would believe them.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>And from “Carole”:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Gaye,</p>
<p>I try to read everything you write on your blog. It is a welcome site in the morning to open my computer and find you there.</p>
<p>I am a young 65 year old and am very much into prepping. My partner is not and there are only the two of us. My brother is somewhat into prepping but I know his heart really isn&#8217;t in to it. It is hard to be able to prep on my own both emotionally and financially.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder is it worth doing all the prepping and the financial cost for it all, thinking that maybe it would be better to use the money for something else or to save it. Currently I spend about $600.00 per month on my prepping.</p>
<p>Yesterday like you I moved some of my food stuffs around, this way I could clean and organize what I have. I found I need more fruit and of course since Mountain House is on sale I will get some entrees. I like to put my foods together and not buy too many entrees because of the use of so much sodium. I buy all the cook books for prepping and so therefore can make about anything.</p>
<p>Okay, so I am bothered and wondering when is it time to stop prepping?  Looking at all the items I do have which are in redundancy as well, I think I want to stop but then I always start back up. I feel as if my life is on hold waiting for something to happen. Do you feel this way by chance? I am consumed with prepping and reading all of the books and blogs, etc on disasters or what might be, and since I don&#8217;t have a group that is into prepping, it can be lonely at times.</p>
<p>I would rather be prepared and nothing happen than for something to happen and not be prepared.</p>
<p>When is enough , enough? I wish I could sit back and relax with the prepping. I enjoy doing it but need some backup or someone to be interested in it as well.</p>
<p>I really appreciate you listening to me and again I enjoy all that you do to help keeping us in the loop and to be there for us. Thank you.</p></blockquote>
<p>My response was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hang in there &#8211; your feelings are normal.  If you can, take a break from prepping for a couple of weeks then come back to it newly renewed.  That said, let us hope and pray that we will never need to use our preps for their intended purpose.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am sharing this conversation with you today so that you know that you may not be the only one feeling uncertain and alone in your prepping activities.  I believe in my advice and indeed, will be taking a break myself for a couple of weeks.  Remember, no one person can do 100% all the time.</p>
<h3>THE BACKDOOR SURVIVAL BLOGROLL</h3>
<p>For months I have been saying that my <a title="Backdoor Survival Blogroll" href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/recommended-sites/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blogroll</a> is a mess and it truly is.</p>
<p>Many of the links are no longer active and many of the sites listed have not posted fresh content in months. Sooooo . . . I plan to take down the Blogroll temporarily until I get things all fixed up.  Just giving you fair warning.</p>

<h3>BACKDOOR SURVIVAL BLOOPERS</h3>
<p>This week I had a blooper that is kind of embarrassing.  Here is what happened.</p>
<p>I few months ago I packaged 50 pounds of rice in a 5 gallon Mylar bag with a 2000 cc oxygen absorber.  For the first time ever, I did not put my packaged food in a bucket or a bin.  Oops.  I must have stacked some items on top of the bag because when I paid a visit to my food storage, there was a big rip in the bag.</p>
<p><img style="float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;" alt="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 82   Backdoor Survival" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7351/9753006274_606ae1d0a0_n.jpg" width="320" height="241" title="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 82   Backdoor Survival" /></p>
<p>I pulled out the duct tape and made a temporary patch but I still need to go back to repackage the rice all over again.  This time I will either put it in a bucket or a bin or even a box.  I share this will you so you will learn from my mistake.  I feel so stupid because of all people, I should know better.</p>
<h3>THE FINAL WORD</h3>
<p><img style="float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;" alt="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 82   Backdoor Survival" src="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Sunday-Survival-Buzz.jpg" width="200" height="200" title="The Sunday Survival Buzz   Volume 82   Backdoor Survival" /></p>
<p>I am almost ready to head out of dodge for a short vacation.  My house sitters are lined up and Tucker the Dog is going to doggie-camp.  My primary vacation prep has been to go on a writing frenzy so that you have lots of Backdoor Survival articles to keep you occupied while I am gone.</p>
<p>In addition, as you may have noticed, I am trying to bring back some of the evergreen articles from the past – you know, things I have written about that have been lost for a couple of years in the archives.  Mostly you will see these on Mondays.  Just between us, I call them my blasts from the past.</p>
<p>So &#8211; what about you – do you have a topic that you would like to see me write about?  I may just have something and will be happy to bring it current for you.  Be sure to let me know in the comment area and I will get right on it.</p>
<p>Until, next time, remember to make every day a prep day!</p>

AN INTERVIEW WITH JOHN FORSYTHE</h3>
<p><strong><span style="color: #666666;">Tell me about your book, Fight, Flight, or Hide. What is it about?</span></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Fight, Flight, or Hide is a book on how to survive a mass shooting. It details different kinds of responses to the emergency, and is intended to be a guide for everyone. It doesn’t matter if you are pro-gun or anti-gun, or if you are of a violent or peaceful person, this book can help you to prepare for that emergency.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="color: #666666;">What type of research did you have to do while writing Fight, Flight, or Hide?</span></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I will admit that I had a lot of fun doing the research for this book. I talked with friends of mine who are in law enforcement and current or ex-military. I also reviewed the incidences of mass shootings in the past, and their conclusions. What I found was a common thread of strategy that was either recommended by law enforcement and military, or seen in history.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="color: #666666;">Why did you decide to write this book?</span></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>After the massacre at Newtown, I started looking on Amazon to see if there were any books on surviving such an event. When I found none that were intended for general use, I decided to write one. There were books intended for those who already carried guns, or those heavily into martial arts, but none for the common person.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="color: #666666;">Every book, fiction and non-fiction, includes a message. What message do you hope my readers will take with them after reading Fight, Flight, or Hide?</span></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The main message of my book is that we can prepare for mass shootings the same way we prepare for any other disaster. We have drills and plans for fires in our homes, for tornadoes and for hurricanes, yet none for mass shootings. They are unpredictable and horrible, and they are hard to understand, but we can be more prepared for them than we are.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="color: #666666;">Can you tell us a little bit more about yourself?</span></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I am a father, a husband, a college administrator and instructor, and a Christian. I am entirely against hurting other people and I find mass shootings to be a cowardly and abhorrent practice. I typically write fantasy and fiction, but stepped out of my norms to address a topic I think is important and relevant.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="color: #666666;">Do you have plans for another book?</span></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I am always writing, more or less, though typically in the fantasy genre. My current project is called Succession of Kings. As a companion to Fight, Flight, or Hide, I plan to write a book on how to prevent mass shootings directly. That topic is also necessary, but will need to be more on the philosophical side of things, where Fight, Flight, or Hide is a practical guide.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="color: #666666;">Is there anything else you would like to share with my readers?</span></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I am preaching to the choir when I tell your readers that we should prepare for emergencies and disasters. They already know that well. What I have to add to the conversation is that we should view mass shootings in the same manner. We can and should prepare. We cannot predict, but we can prepare.</p></blockquote>
<h3>THE BOOK GIVEAWAY</h3>

<h3>THE FINAL WORD</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I have to say it.  I have a special fondness for this e-book and its realistic approach to what to do if you are unlucky to be involved in a mass choosing.  Here is what I said in my Amazon review:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>This book is all about putting you in the right frame of mind for dealing with a mass shooting and a mass shooter &#8211; if it is at all possible to prepare, that is.</em></p>
<p><em>Are you a victim, guardian or hero? And does it matter?  You are going to be surprised by the answers. Please, if you live in an urban area &#8211; and whether you love guns or hate guns &#8211; consider this e-book. It is not about firearms. It is about saving your own life when faced with a mass shooter.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Please take a few moments to enter this giveaway and if you are not the winner, consider purchasing this book.  I do not make many book endorsements but this one is well deserved.</p>
<p align="left"><em><span style="color: #9b00d3;"><span style="color: #800040;"><span style="color: #9b00d3;"><span style="color: #9e1f63;">Enjoy your next adventure through common sense and thoughtful preparation!<br />

<p>Think about it.  In addition to drinking water, we have our gardens to water, our animals to tend to, our cookware to clean, and our personal hygiene needs.  Add all of these up and you can see that in an extended drought or a breakdown in traditional water delivery systems, our precious drinking water may be called into use for other purposes.</p>

<p>Here is his story.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Water, Water Everywhere, but not a Drop to Drink!</b></p>
<p>Water is life; water is everything to survival and is an essential concern every survivalist must adequately address.  Ensuring your ability to convert whatever water you find into safe drinking water is a necessity for all preppers. Unfortunately, some of man’s technical threats are worse than the best water purifying processes most of us can afford; however, there are still excellent choices for survivalists and preppers when it comes to purifying water for drinking.</p>
<p>Having lived off-grid for most of my adult life, I have come to appreciate what water really means to our survival and how important it is for preppers and survivalists living on the grid to share this understanding.  When your supply of drinking water comes from the kitchen faucet, a drinking fountain, or even a clear plastic bottle with trendy paper label on it, it’s easy to forget that it’s not an endless supply.</p>
<p>Our time in Arizona saw 15 years of very little rain and countless trips to town to fill our 350-gallon transfer tank in order to keep our 2500-gallon and 1600-gallon water storage tanks full. We could have survived a good length of time had we rationed our storage properly and used the 4100 gallons of stored water for coffee, but my wife quickly put an end to that. She insisted on watering the goats, chickens, cats, and dogs, in addition to watering her tomato and pepper plants. She also required us to shower on occasion, which kept my coffee water storage supply constantly in need of being replenished.</p>
<p>As my wife taught me, eventually you will run out of water. Of course, since we had no rain to fill our animal, shower, and other non-drinking needs, we were forced to use our drinking water supply for other things around the ranch.</p>
<p>When the SHTF you MUST manage your drinking water. Not only will your stored supply eventually run out, but your water filters won’t last forever either.  In my opinion, the best filter system available today (the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007U00YE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0007U00YE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=continmoti-20" target="_blank">Katadyn Pocket Water Microfilter</a><img style="margin: 0px;" alt="Survival Friday: Water Everywhere But Not a Drop to Drink   Backdoor Survival" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=continmoti-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0007U00YE" width="1" height="1" border="0" title="Survival Friday: Water Everywhere But Not a Drop to Drink   Backdoor Survival" /> ), when used gently in a long-term crisis, will typically last approximately 13,000 gallons. One popular countertop drip filter system will typically last for up to 3000 gallons per filter when gently used.  When I suggest “gentle use”, what I mean is that you’re not running mucky creek water through it; instead, you have only run clarified water through the filters.</p>
<p>Every effort must be taken to protect your water filter from sediment which will ultimately clog it and end its service life. Since money is always a concern, purchasing the best and then taking excellent care of it should be everyone’s plan of action. Don’t be fooled into thinking you can skimp here. How much is your life worth anyway?</p>
<p>My own water management plan includes the Katadyn Micro pocket filter, a countertop system, and multiple 5-gallon pails for use in letting water sit and rest in order to allow sediment to sink to the bottom of the pail.</p>
<p><img alt="Survival Friday: Water Everywhere But Not a Drop to Drink   Backdoor Survival" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3746/9626942362_90e29311ec_m.jpg" width="123" height="240" title="Survival Friday: Water Everywhere But Not a Drop to Drink   Backdoor Survival" />        <img alt="Survival Friday: Water Everywhere But Not a Drop to Drink   Backdoor Survival" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7376/9626942738_32b10e6940_n.jpg" width="320" height="240" title="Survival Friday: Water Everywhere But Not a Drop to Drink   Backdoor Survival" /></p>
<p>Even the most turbid river and lake water can become drastically cleaner by allowing it to settle for hours or even days. Once the heavy sediment has settled to the bottom of the pail, it can be carefully transferred to another clean pail and allowed to rest for additional time to use cleaning dishes, clothes, or bathing or, if clean enough, run through your water filter system for drinking and cooking needs.</p>
<p>This week I added another water purifying system to my retreat’s equipment options that will see me well past the time all my spare filters become clogged and worn-out. In fact, this system actually does a better job purifying water than any of my other filter systems can do.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DIRZPM0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DIRZPM0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=continmoti-20" target="_blank">Survival Still</a> offers a long-term solution to water purifying needs in an emergency situation.  There are no filters to clog or replace, and it’s made of stainless steel. I don’t see how it won’t last forever when taken care of. Its design is simple and uses your own pots as the boiling base pot and the condenser top-pot. These two pots must meet stated diameters but are common sizes most people would typically already have.</p>
<p><img style="float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;" alt="Survival Friday: Water Everywhere But Not a Drop to Drink   Backdoor Survival" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7303/9626942558_1b3cd0eb19_n.jpg" width="251" height="320" title="Survival Friday: Water Everywhere But Not a Drop to Drink   Backdoor Survival" /></p>
<p>This distillation system works by first boiling the water which kills microorganisms and bacteria, then collects the steam from the boiled water and condenses it back to water in a purified form which travels through a tube and into your collection container. Distilling water with the Survival Still will also allow anyone living along the coast to convert sea water into drinking water. This method is not as fast as using a filter, and it requires energy to boil the pot; however, the water you get from distillation will be pure, and there are no mechanical parts, filters, or seals to wear out. It is basic water purification.</p>
<p>Whether you’re preparing for natural disasters, a societal collapse, or just prepping for the next terrorist event, being able to purify water is essential to your survival. The Survival Still should be found in everyone’s gear. Don’t be caught with water, water everywhere, but none fit to drink!</p></blockquote>
<h3>The Final Word</h3>
<p>Since participating in the book festivals, F.J. and I have kept in touch and I have come to respect and appreciate his sincerity when it comes to his desire to help others in their quest for self-sufficiency.  He has truly walked the walk in that a number of years ago, he and his wife pull their four sons from public school and set off in a converted school bus to the American Southwest to live life off-grid with a very limited budget.</p>
<p>I am especially grateful to F.J. for sharing his wisdom and knowledge with us and hope that he will come back to join us on another Survival Friday.</p>

<p>Living on a ranch (more of a tree farm now) in East Texas, he has everything needed to review fuel preservation solutions like the ones offered by the PRI-D folks which quite coincidentally, readers have also asked about.</p>

<p>First, here is the report from George.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Secrets of Successful Diesel Storage</h3>
<p>When we moved up to our slice of the Outback , we were typical city-slickers, although I’d worked a bit summers as a boy in Eastern Washington, I got my first D-6 <i>Cat</i> bulldozer stuck in soft dirt along Crab Creek (just over the hill from Hanford) at age 12. Ever since then, my relation with diesels has had its ups and downs.</p>
<p>A diesel engine is an incredibly simple machine, at least in principle. There is no ignition system, per se. As a cylinder is about to begin its compression stroke, a high pressure pump squirts a precise amount of fuel into the cylinder. Because air heats when it’s compressed enough, eventually, with a compression ratio up over 20 to 1 in many cases, the injected fuel explodes and that’s where the power comes from.</p>
<p>To be sure, compression ratios as low as 14 can be used, but there are tradeoffs, not the least of which is the ability to fire off on cold mornings. A typical farm tractor may have diesel with under 20:1 compression, but in these instances, the engine is usually equipped with a pre-heater (or <i>glow</i>) plug.</p>
<p>In cold weather starts, the glow plug is run for 15-seconds, or so, and then cranking begins.</p>
<p>If you’re ever in a survival situation with a diesel engine, there was an old trick used by SeaBees during WW II when they were cat-skinning in Alaska to start cranky diesels on cold mornings: They’d shove a rag into the exhaust pipe! Believe it, or not, this small increase in back-pressure into the engine was sometimes enough to light off a cranky diesel.</p>
<p>Gaye’s product review offer couldn’t have come at a better time, since I’ve been having one of the “downs” in my relationship with diesels. The reason, as it turns out was simple enough when I took a small sample of diesel out of one of our 55-gallon storage drums to see what the fuel looked like. Not pretty…</p>
<p><img style="float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;" alt="Secrets of Successful Fuel Storage   Backdoor Survival" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3742/9729081150_e466f2ac64_o.jpg" width="403" height="176" title="Secrets of Successful Fuel Storage   Backdoor Survival" /></p>
<p>Using an old wine jug, I let the fuel settle for a day and snapped this picture. What it shows is two layers had formed. The bottom one was clear liquid – water with some barrel rust in it and other impurities – while the top layer above was a kind of gooey tar-like substance.</p>
<p>You’ll see in the pictures as we go through my report here, a kind of “red” cast to the diesel. That’s because agricultural use diesel (“ag-diesel”) has red dye added to it so you can be caught and fined for running farm diesel on the highway if you have a diesel powered car or truck and the inclination to be something of a chiseler on taxes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, farm diesel runs just fine and presumably, in the event of a National Emergency, or whatever, bureaucrats would have other worries than handing out fines for running lower tax diesel, but you never know about these things, so it’s a judgment call on your part.</p>
<p>Be advised, in many states, especially Texas, you need to have a state-issued permit just to <i>buy</i> the farm diesel and you’ll periodically get polled by mail that you still operate a farm or ranch and are a legitimate user of farm-dyed red diesel if you’re not running “road” diesel.</p>
<p>After reading through the brochure from PRI-D, I found confirmation of what I had previously (and wrongheadedly) thought was algae in the dark goo layer. Not so. It turns out that when diesel is refined, it’s not just a single level distillate in the cracking tower of the refinery.</p>
<p>So it’s <i>not</i> algae, but rather some of the cracked “tars” and heavier distillates getting back together again and they can turn into fairly large tar-ball goo and that’s not going to run nicely, since it can plug up the fuel oil filter and muck up the diesel fuel pump.</p>
<p>Diesel can include something of a range of distillates when being made, more so than gasoline for sure, and depending on how much of what is used in the diesel blend, there may be more of the heavier distillates than the lighter products used in gasoline. That, plus heat (or time) is what caused diesel to go bad. While <i>PRI-D</i> is already well-established for keeping diesel from break down well past the advertised 10-year mark, my problem was a little different. I wanted to get the diesel back into useful condition <i>after</i> it has goo ’ed up…that was my problem at hand.</p>
<p>Why so much focus on diesel? It comes down to two reasons, really: One is in fuel weight. For reference, a gallon of water weighs 8-pounds (“A pint’s a pound, the world around”). Gasoline weighs about 6-pounds per gallon and diesel (depending on blend and temperature) will come in around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_gallon_equivalent" target="_blank">7.1-pounds per gallon</a>.</p>
<p>I know…you’re thinking “<i>Does that mean diesel, gallon for gallon can get more work done?</i>” Absolutely. If you look over here at the gallon equivalent of gasoline tables, you’ll see that base gasoline has about 114,000 British Thermal Units of heating power (potential work) per gallon. But diesel has 129,500 BTU’s worth or almost 13.3% more work in it for a given <i>volume</i> of product.</p>
<p>Diesels are even starting to move into some unique applications, too. For example, the <a href="http://www.aopa.org/News-and-Video/All-News/2013/August/1/Will-we-all-be-flying-diesels.aspx" target="_blank">Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association</a> recently reported on Lycoming’s drive to introduce a Jet-A fuel burning diesel to the aviation market. Presently in the US, low lead av-gas is cheap compared to Europe where it can top $20 a gallon. Diesel airplanes may have a bright future.</p>
<p>Those are dreams for the tractor-ing set, mostly, so back to my wine jug sample: It seemed obvious to me that somehow water had gotten into my tank (the one that was open) but I didn’t think nearly <i>this much</i> water would come in simply due to condensation. Upon doing some inspection after a heavy rainfall, I found (thanks to wind) that I was getting enough water onto the tank-top that unfortunately a few drops had gotten in the fuel.</p>
<p><img style="float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;" alt="Secrets of Successful Fuel Storage   Backdoor Survival" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7309/9725850529_e18a6ff87a_n.jpg" width="320" height="231" title="Secrets of Successful Fuel Storage   Backdoor Survival" /></p>
<p>And, to make matters worse, there was also a fair amount of pine needles that had accumulated on the drum.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a sharp eye for farmerly things, you’ll notice the distinct lack of rust on the manual rotary pump fitting that screws into the top of the tank. That’s because this is one of those fancy aluminum pumps which I spent a few extra bucks on, thinking it would pay off.</p>
<p>Save your money: This one hasn’t lasted any longer than the previous one, which I got just four years of service from. The problem is the pump vanes inside the pump head deteriorate fairly quickly, so I’ve got a note on my “farm supplies list” to pick up another back-up diesel pump. To be sure, you can get diesel moved around with a syphon, but getting a mouthful of diesel is not something you’ll be anxious to do often, although I’ve been reduced to it a few times in a pinch, but a bulb-type diesel and gas transfer system can be had at Amazon which will make life easier if (should I say when?) the vane typed rotary pump fails.</p>
<p>The next step in the review was to load up some jugs of diesel and put them side-by-side to see how they would clean up with <i>PRI-D</i> added to one, but not the other.</p>
<p>Here’s what the results looked like using a bit more than recommended (a tablespoon per gallon) after three minutes:<img style="float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;" alt="Secrets of Successful Fuel Storage   Backdoor Survival" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3703/9729081358_144c32c935_n.jpg" width="320" height="237" title="Secrets of Successful Fuel Storage   Backdoor Survival" /></p>
<p>It was pretty obvious that the PRI-D was doing its magic, breaking down the gobs into something that my old Kubota could digest more happily!</p>
<p>After letting the jugs sit for a while, as the one on the right continued to clarify more over the next hour or two, it was becoming clear that what my Dirty Diesel contained was being sorted into three layers.</p>
<p><img style="float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;" alt="Secrets of Successful Fuel Storage   Backdoor Survival" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5531/9729081442_7985d4e033_n.jpg" width="320" height="237" title="Secrets of Successful Fuel Storage   Backdoor Survival" /></p>
<p>I didn’t get pictures of it, but once the settling was done (I gave it 24-hours not because it needed more than a couple, but because I got busy around the ranch with other chores) I simply decanted off the good fuel into the tractor.</p>
<p>OK, fine, the PRI-D solved <i>part</i> of my problem, but that left a really ugly bunch of goo in the bottom of the wine jugs. What to do with that?</p>
<p>Eventually it dawned on me that I could collect those two bottom layers and toss them into a bucket. Once all the diesel had been polished (as fuel cleaning is called), I would simply wait until we get back into the rainy season here in East Texas and dump the residue onto a burn pile of fallen tree limbs and such that accumulate over a season, along with dead trees that get pushed up into monster brush piles which are then burned.</p>
<p>Burning as hot as a 15-foot wall of fire does, I figure that will be the end of my leftover residue problem.</p>
<p>Over the course of doing research for this article, I had developed a numbers of questions which Ralph Lewis of PRI-D was kind enough to answer, and in particular, I asked about the idea of adding some gas or diesel line dryer to the fuel to “suck some of the water” out and put it back into a form that might be passed into the engine to burn…</p>
<p>Heck, I thought that might have saved me some decanting work, right? No, bad plan explained Ralph’s email:</p>
<p>“One of the worst things you can do is to use a glycol/alcohol based additive to try to emulsify water in fuel. Never a good idea. Problem is simple. When encapsulated water hits a hot injector tip, it expands rapidly to steam and can literally distort or destroy the aperture of the injector. Any product that claims “makes water disappear” or “gets rid of water” is one to completely avoid!</p>
<p>Even so, most consumer additive makers make products for water emulsification &#8211; relying on the ignorance of the consumer in these matters. I suppose we could as well, but doing so would be a gross disservice to consumers.</p>
<p>Regarding long-term fuel storage – some simple practices will avoid the issue you observed. First – always best to keep tanks topped off, leaving little “head” space in which condensation will form. Second, always a good idea to have a good water separation filter on the tank intake line (assuming this is a large fuel tank). Third – a good idea to have a second water separation on the output line. I have attached a paper with fuel storage recommendations – mostly aimed at large commercial tanks, although they can apply to smaller tanks as well.</p>
<p>Personally, I keep all of my prep fuel stored in small plastic gas cans – and I keep them in a dry, cool place. Properly treated with PRI-G – or if diesel – with PRI-D – the fuel will literally last for many years. In fact, I had some fuel stored for 14 years, treated only once with PRI-G, that functioned perfectly when I finally used it.”</p>
<p>The main thing to plan on, if your prepping involves storing fuel, is to understand that fresh gasoline (no ethanol) left untreated may last only a year, or so, before it begins to “varnish” and, after that how your equipment reacts to it may be something of a crap-shoot.</p>
<p>One of the applications around the ranch (besides the tractor and back-up generator diesel fuel) where I’ve become something of a rabid convert is the <i>PRI-G</i> product where the G stands for gas. We have been on a vicious cycle the past few years of taking several piece of gear down to the local small engine shop every spring to get them running again after starter fluid and no end of curse words wouldn’t start them.</p>
<p>I’m banking on not doing that next year because I will end the season by running av-gas treated with PRI-G through them. Then, if I don’t take the time to get them running about mid-winter, it may not matter since the varnish is what gums up the carb floats and clogs jets, especially the low-speed idle just on small two-cycle engines.</p>
<p>As to the diesel? Well, I’ve now transitioned to the plastic tanks – which I’d picked up a while ago and those, I was told, were much less likely to collect condensation and, even better, they don’t rust.</p>
<p>And this brings me to one more oddity, which I picked up from carefully reading <i>Power Research Incorporated</i> (the <i>PRI </i>of the PRI-D and PRI-G products): They specifically say that the main factors impacting storage are: “<i>Heat, water, copper or copper alloys, and zinc&#8211; should be excluded as much as possible</i>.”</p>
<h4>The Rules of Fuel Storage</h4>
<p><i>Power Research</i> also publishes a list of key things to keep in mind when storing fuel:</p>
<p><i>1. The product should be placed in underground storage.</i></p>
<p><i>2. If tankage is aboveground, it should be sheltered. Tanks and aboveground lines should be coated with reflective paint to minimize heating of the fuel.</i></p>
<p><i>3. Tank should be checked for product last stored to prevent contamination of fresh product.</i></p>
<p><i>4. All rust and tank scale should be removed.</i></p>
<p><i>5. Storage tank should be checked for water monthly, and more frequently in winter months.</i></p>
<p><i>6. If water is present, it should be removed at once by bleeding from the bottom of aboveground tanks or pumping it out of underground tanks.</i></p>
<p><i>7. In the event biological growth is found in the fuel tank, there are biocides that will destroy or control this type of contamination. The better practice is to keep the tank free of water.</i></p>
<p><i>8. If the tank is underground, make certain the fill stem is tight and protected to prevent seepage of ground water into the tank.</i></p>
<p><i>9. Check all pipe fittings for leakage.</i></p>
<p><i>1O. Make certain no zinc, copper or copper alloys come in contact with the fuel. Any found should be removed. Tanks and piping should be of suitable reinforced plastic. If plastic cannot be used, black iron is the second best choice.</i></p>
<p><i>11 Have suitable filters installed on dispensing equipment to remove any particulate material, which might collect in tank and contaminate the fuel.</i></p>
<p><i>12 If possible, provide a floating suction intake. The cleanest fuel is normally found at the uppermost level of the fuel.</i></p>
<p><i>13. A pressure/vacuum relief valve should be installed on aboveground gasoline tanks. Such valves must be checked periodically in freezing weather to assure that they are not frozen shut. A frozen pressure/vacuum valve can cause a tank to collapse when product is pumped out. Tanks with bolted tops must have a tight top seal.”</i></p>
<p>Now that I know what I’ve been doing wrong, I have added a couple of more points to their checklist:</p>
<p><i>14. Store your fuel out of the sun, at least in a shady area if you’re in hot country.</i></p>
<p><i>15. Insist on using plastic 55-gallons drums is possible.</i></p>
<p><i>16. Don’t leave the fuel pump in the diesel tank because it allows air and (in my case) water to get in, which will cause work down the road.</i></p>
<p><i>17. Have at least two or three barrel bung wrenches around – they aren’t too spendy.</i></p>
<p><i>18. If you’re gong to be moving fuel, the safety way is with a barrel lifting arm which can be had from Harbor Freight and other heavy-duty hardware outfits.</i></p>
<p><i>19. Keep your equipment tanks full after use. (This got drummed into me on airplanes, but remembering to do it after tractor-ing isn’t as easy as it sounds when images of a cool shower and visions of a cold Bud are dancing in your head.)</i></p>
<p>The 20<sup>th</sup> rule may be the most important of all:</p>
<p>Don’t store fuel or flammable liquids near any possible ignition source. I have had had plastic jugs develop cracked seams over time and so keep them all outside, away from the family home. Fire prevention is everyone’s job. Oh, and keep it under lock and key, as rule 20½ . There’s just too much trouble bad people (or kids) can get into with a five gallon jug of fuel!</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Final Word</h3>
<p>For 20 years the Survival Husband and I owned a diesel-powered boat.  We knew that if we wanted the engine to run &#8211; let along purr &#8211; during the Spring and Summer boating season, we needed to add a diesel preservative to prevent the nasties from growing in the fuel tanks over the winter.  The same rule applies to the fuel we store for our generator and other prepping purposes.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that sometimes it is the little things that make all of the difference.</p>

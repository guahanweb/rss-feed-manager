<p>Is Obama insane?</p>
<p>In Pakistan, the Taliban (a very close cousin of al-Qaeda) has already claimed responsibility for the worst church bombing in the history of that nation.  The attack left <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2429074/Pakistan-church-blast-2-suicide-bombers-kill-85-attack-countrys-Christians.html">85 dead and nearly twice that many wounded</a>.  To say that this was a horrific attack would be a massive understatement&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The attack on All Saints Church, which also wounded 140 people, underlines the threat posed by the Pakistani Taliban at a time when the government is seeking a peace deal with the militants.</p>
<p>The attack occurred as hundreds of worshippers were coming out of the church in the city&#8217;s Kohati Gate district after services to get a free meal of rice.</p>
<p>&#8216;There were blasts and there was hell for all of us,&#8217; said Nazir John, who was at the church with at least 400 other worshippers.</p>
<p>&#8216;When I got my senses back, I found nothing but smoke, dust, blood and screaming people. I saw severed body parts and blood all around.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Who would do something like that?</p>
<p>In Kenya, a team of Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed a shopping mall in Nairobi and murdered at least 62 people.</p>
<p>What makes that attack even more disturbing is that the terrorists specifically targeted non-Muslims.</p>
<p>In fact, hostages were given a test by the terrorists to determine whether or not they were actually Muslims.  Those that failed the test <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/10327233/Nairobi-shopping-mall-attack-all-we-could-hear-was-screaming-and-shooting.html">were executed</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The reason the Islamists targeted the Westgate shopping centre was clear from the moment they stormed inside brandishing AK-47s and grenades. Anyone who was not a Muslim, or could not prove that they were, was immediately targeted. Reports from separate floors of the building in the first hours of the assault told how the attackers, speaking rough Swahili and English, shouted at Muslims to identify themselves.</p>
<p>Many people came forward. They were ordered to speak in Arabic, or to recite a verse from the Koran, or to name the Prophet Mohammed’s mother. Those who passed this test were allowed to flee. Those that did not were executed, including children.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can find some very graphic pictures of the attack <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2428875/Terror-Kenya-Survivors-reveal-gunman-executed-non-Muslims.html">right here</a>.</p>
<p>Are you starting to understand why I use words such as &#8220;psychotic&#8221; to describe these terrorists?</p>
<p>And all over the world these radical jihadists seem to have a particular hatred for Christians.</p>
<p>Just consider what has happened in Egypt over the past few months.  After the Egyptian military removed the Muslim Brotherhood from power, radical Islamists responded by <a href="http://frontpagemag.com/2013/raymond-ibrahim/a-christian-pogrom-in-egypt/">destroying more than 80 Christian churches</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>On July 4th, the day after the Egyptian military liberated the nation of Muslim Brotherhood rule, Christian Copts were immediately scapegoated and targeted.  All Islamist leaders—from Brotherhood supreme leader Muhammad Badi, to Egyptian-born al-Qaeda leader Ayman Zawahiri, to top Sunni cleric Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi—made it a point to single out Egypt’s Copts as being especially instrumental in the ousting of former Islamist president Morsi, ushering in a month of pogroms against the nation’s Christian minority.</p>
<p>Among other things in July, unprecedented numbers of Christian churches were attacked, plundered, desecrated, and torched.  According to one Egyptian human rights lawyer, “<a href="http://www.aina.org/news/20130818125428.htm">82 churches, many of which were from the 5th century</a>, were attacked by pro-Morsi supporters in just two days.” Al-Qaeda’s flag was raised above some churches; anti-Christian graffiti littered the sides of other churches and Coptic homes.  Due to extreme anti-Christian sentiment, many churches ceased holding worship services until recently.  Dozens of Coptic homes and businesses were also attacked, looted, and torched.</p></blockquote>
<p>Should the U.S. military ever be used <strong>to help</strong> radial jihadists that would commit such horrible acts?</p>
<p>That is such a crazy question that you would think that nobody would ever have to ask such a thing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that is exactly what Barack Obama wants to do.</p>
<p>In Syria, radical jihadists are doing all of the same kinds of things that you just read about.  As I have written about on numerous occasions, the Syrian &#8220;rebels&#8221; are <a title="slaughtering Christians" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-u-s-military-does-not-want-to-fight-for-al-qaeda-christian-killers-in-syria" target="_blank">savagely killing Christians</a>, <a title="using chemical weapons" href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/the-un-has-had-evidence-that-syrian-rebels-have-been-using-chemical-weapons-since-may" target="_blank">repeatedly using chemical weapons</a> and <a title="dismembering little girls" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/precious-little-girl-dismembered-while-she-is-still-alive-by-obamas-psychotic-syrian-rebels" target="_blank">dismembering little girls</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/syrian-rebels-to-christian-woman-after-slitting-her-fiances-throat-jesus-didnt-come-to-save-him">previous article</a>, I included eyewitness testimony <a title="from a Christian missionary" href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/06/syrian-rebels-to-christians-flee-or-die/" target="_blank">from a Christian missionary</a> who explained what happens when the &#8220;rebels&#8221; take over a Christian area in Syria…</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Christian residents were offered four choices: 1. renounce the ‘idolatry’ of Christianity and convert to Islam; 2. pay a heavy tribute to the Muslims for the privilege of keeping their heads and their Christian faith (this tribute is known as jizya); 3. be killed; 4. flee for their lives, leaving all their belongings behind.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now this sick philosophy is even rubbing off on little children.  In the Syrian town of Ras al-Ayn, children <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/children-in-syrian-town-simulating-beheadings-of-enemies.html">were recently filmed</a> pretending to behead their enemies while shouting Allahu Akbar.</p>
<p>What kind of place will Syria become if Obama is successful and the Assad regime is removed?</p>
<p>Will it become a jihadist paradise where Christians and all other non-Muslims are systematically exiled or exterminated?</p>
<p>These jihadists are a cancer, and Obama seems absolutely determined to help that cancer spread in Syria and beyond.</p>
<p>What in the world is he thinking?</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We opened up the carrier and stood in complete shock,&#8221; said Laura Zain, founder of the nonprofit. &#8220;It was the worst thing I&#8217;ve ever seen in 25 years of doing this. I&#8217;ve never seen something so sadistic, ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emaciated, feverish, with pale gums and covered with fleas, Hope&#8217;s worst problem was deep, severe burns on her back, sides and ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;She absolutely was set on fire,&#8221; Zain said.</p>
<p>The veterinarian confirmed that Hope had been tortured and set on fire.</p></blockquote>
<p>How sick and twisted do you have to be to do something like that?</p>
<p>There are other sickos out there that want to do absolutely nightmarish things to our children.</p>
<p>For example, just check out what one man in the Boston area <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/12/justice/cannibal-eat-children-case/index.html?hpt=hp_t3">planned to do</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A Boston-area man, who was planning to kidnap children, lock them in a basement dungeon, rape and eat them, should be imprisoned for at least 27 years, federal authorities said in court documents filed this week.</p>
<p class="cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph2">Geoffrey Portway pleaded guilty in May to distribution and possession of child pornography and solicitation to commit a crime of violence, according to court documents. He is scheduled to be sentenced on September 17.</p>
<p class="cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph3">&#8220;Portway has pled guilty to some of the most vile and heinous crimes known to our society,&#8221; federal prosecutors wrote in a sentencing recommendation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph3">I am normally not squeamish when it comes to describing the evil that is overtaking our society, but what this monster was planning to do to children is so horrific that I cannot even include it in this article.</p>
<p class="cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph3">If you would like to read the rest of the CNN article, you can find it <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/12/justice/cannibal-eat-children-case/index.html?hpt=hp_t3">right here</a>.</p>
<p class="cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph3">Are you convinced that we are a nation of sickos yet?</p>
<p>If not, perhaps reading what happened to a <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/09/13/imagine-the-suffering-of-her-family-gop-rep-speaks-out-about-93-year-old-grandmother-allegedly-raped-and-murdered-by-illegal-immigrant/">93-year-old woman in Nebraska</a> will persuade you&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>In July, 93-year-old native Nebraskan Louise Sollowin was <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/07/26/raped-and-beaten-93-year-old-woman-dies-after-man-who-may-be-an-illegal-alien-found-naked-passed-out-and-lying-on-top-of-her/">brutally murdered</a> in the home she lived in for more than 70 years. She was beaten and raped, allegedly by a 19-year-old illegal immigrant from Mexico.</p></blockquote>
<p>The following is how <a href="http://www.timesrepublican.com/page/content.detail/id/563686/Honor-Louise-at-Friday-vigil.html?nav=5004">a local Iowa paper</a> described the crime&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>After being arrested Sergio, through an interpreter, reportedly admitted to beating and raping Louise. He said he had been drinking heavily and was &#8220;angry with women.&#8221; He stated he had been working as a roofer. The autopsy report listed &#8220;blunt force trauma, broken cheekbones, head injuries, broken teeth, broken ribs and a broken nose.&#8221; Sergio had never met the grandmother prior to the attack. The police report stated there was blood on &#8220;walls, floor, ceiling and bed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>How far gone do you have to be to treat a 93-year-old woman that way?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of the time our only &#8220;help&#8221; comes from the police, and often they are some of the sickest ones of all.  In California, police officers routinely take injured dogs and cats out to the shooting range <a href="http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2013/09/12/merced-police-policy-of-taking-injured-animals-to-shooting-range-comes-under-fire/#.UjKLgmTQ_v4.facebook">and shoot them</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Animal lovers are questioning a policy where Merced Police officers take injured animals out to the police shooting range to kill them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The penal code has been on the books for decades. Some officers say it’s the most humane thing you can do, while others call it barbaric.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Officers use deadly force to save the lives of others, but what about shooting severely injured dogs or cats found on the street?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course some of the worst sickos of all are walking the halls of power in Washington.  I have written dozens of articles about <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/category/corruption">the corruption of our politicians</a>, and now those same politicians want to start a war with Syria and use the U.S. military to help murderous jihadists that are loyal to al-Qaeda take over Syria.</p>
<p>The brutality of these so-called &#8220;rebels&#8221; knows no limits.  Just check out the following example from <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2420263/Syrian-civil-war-rebels-behead-Assads-thugs-children-really-sides.html">the Daily Mail</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The sword rests briefly on his neck as a blindfolded man kneels under a clear blue sky.</p>
<p>Moments later, the executioner raises his right arm, slashes downwards and the prisoner is dead.</p>
<p>The whole barbaric episode is watched by a crowd of jeering men, many of them armed.</p>
<p>And sitting on a low wall only a few feet from where the wretched captive died so violently is a line of young boys.</p>
<p>They were still there as the dead man’s head was dumped on his body.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is who Barack Obama wants us to be allied with?</p>
<p>This is who Barack Obama is sending weapons to right now?</p>
<p>As I noted <a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/syrian-rebels-to-christian-woman-after-slitting-her-fiances-throat-jesus-didnt-come-to-save-him">the other day</a>, these psychotic predators are <a title="slaughtering Christians" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-u-s-military-does-not-want-to-fight-for-al-qaeda-christian-killers-in-syria" target="_blank">ruthlessly murdering Christians</a>, <a title="using chemical weapons" href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/the-un-has-had-evidence-that-syrian-rebels-have-been-using-chemical-weapons-since-may" target="_blank">using chemical weapons</a> and <a title="dismembering little girls" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/precious-little-girl-dismembered-while-she-is-still-alive-by-obamas-psychotic-syrian-rebels" target="_blank">dismembering little girls</a>.</p>
<p>But none of that bothers Barack Obama.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="http://rt.com/news/syria-uk-us-france-919/">it has been announced</a> that we are going to be giving even more help to these human monsters&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The US, UK and France have agreed to bolster Syrian rebels by providing more help, press Syria into delivering on its promise to hand over chemical weapons and seek an end to the conflict, which would involve ousting of President Bashar Assad.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is hard to find words to describe how foolish that is.</p>
<p>But this is what is happening to our society.  We celebrate sin and we have almost lost all sense of what right and wrong are.</p>
<p>For instance, do you remember that disgusting performance that Miley Cyrus put on at the video music awards a while back?</p>
<p>Well, now ticket sales for her events are soaring.  Everyone wants to see her.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are at least a few people out there that were willing to stand up and speak out against what they saw that evening.  The following are <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/miley-cyrus-fcc-complaints-679123">a few examples</a> from some of the complaints that were sent to the federal government&#8230;</p>
<p>* <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/miley-cyrus-fcc-letters?page=19http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/miley-cyrus-fcc-letters?page=18">“My family was horrified by this performance.”</a></p>
<p>* <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/miley-cyrus-fcc-letters?page=20">“She should be banned from all TV performances in the future!”</a></p>
<p>* Cyrus was <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/miley-cyrus-fcc-letters?page=4">“acting like a devil flicking that tongue as deamons do.”</a></p>
<p>* Cyrus engaged in <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/miley-cyrus-fcc-letters?page=5">“implied sexual acts with bears.”</a></p>
<p>* <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/miley-cyrus-fcc-letters?page=8">“The scars on our childrens minds cannot be easily erased.”</a></p>
<p>* Woman’s 10-year-old girl <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/miley-cyrus-fcc-letters?page=11">“was compelled to bury her head under the covers.”</a></p>
<p>* <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/miley-cyrus-fcc-letters?page=22">“Good heavens! I’m certainly no prude, but even I was shocked.”</a></p>
<p>* Cyrus appeared <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/miley-cyrus-fcc-letters?page=23">“under the influence of drugs or alcohol.”</a></p>
<p>* <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/miley-cyrus-fcc-letters?page=24">“Just disgusting and almost made me want to puke.”</a></p>
<p>* <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/miley-cyrus-fcc-letters?page=26">“As an educator I have to stand up and say, ‘Enough is enough.’”</a></p>
<p>But of course those comments represent the &#8220;lunatic religious fringe&#8221;, right?</p>
<p>Because these days America has no problem with performers such as Miley Cyrus.</p>
<p>In fact, we celebrate them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the truth is that Miley Cyrus is simply a reflection of what is happening to our families and to our society as a whole.</p>
<p>At this point, the family in America is in the worst shape <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/27-facts-that-prove-that-the-family-in-america-is-in-the-worst-shape-ever">that it ever has been before</a>.  The following are just a few statistics that show this&#8230;</p>
<p>-More than half of the women under the age of 30 that are giving birth in America today <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/18/us/for-women-under-30-most-births-occur-outside-marriage.html?_r=0">are unmarried</a>.</p>
<p>-For couples that have children that are just &#8220;living together&#8221;, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/modern-american-family-redefined-2013-9">two-thirds</a> of them split up by the time they have a child turn 10 years of age.</p>
<p>-At this point, approximately <a title="one out of every three U.S. children" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/dec/25/fathers-disappear-from-households-across-america/print/" target="_blank">one out of every three children</a> in the United States lives in a home without a father.</p>
<p>For much more on this, please see my previous article entitled &#8220;<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/27-facts-that-prove-that-the-family-in-america-is-in-the-worst-shape-ever">27 Facts That Prove That The Family In America Is In The Worst Shape Ever</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>But of course not everyone is a sicko.</p>
<p>There are still some people out there that are trying to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Just consider the following recent example from the <a href="http://boston.cbslocal.com/2013/09/15/good-samaritan-returns-backpack-full-of-cash-passport/">Boston area</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A homeless man turned in a backpack with $2,400 in cash, $39,500 in travelers checks and a passport that he found at South Bay Mall in Dorchester.</p>
<p>Boston Police officers at South Bay Mall were flagged down by the man in front of the TJ Maxx Store.</p>
<p>The man said he found a black backpack that contained a large sum of money and a passport in the front of the store.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p>Is there hope for America?</p>

<p><strong>#1 Assad <a href="https://twitter.com/ReutersWorld/status/378181189703442432">wants a guarantee</a> that he will not be attacked by the United States or by anyone else before he will give up his chemical weapons.</strong></p>
<p>That is extremely unlikely to happen.</p>
<p><strong>#2 Assad is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-russian-syria-deal-cant-be-accepted-2013-9">not going to agree to any chemical weapons deal</a> unless the U.S. stops giving weapons to al-Qaeda terrorists and other jihadist rebels that are fighting against the Syrian government.</strong></p>
<p>That is extremely unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>In fact, according to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-begins-weapons-delivery-to-syrian-rebels/2013/09/11/9fcf2ed8-1b0c-11e3-a628-7e6dde8f889d_story.html?wpisrc=al_national">the Washington Post</a>, the U.S. has been ramping up the delivery of weapons to jihadist rebels in Syria&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The CIA has begun delivering weapons to rebels in Syria, ending months of delay in lethal aid that had been promised by the Obama administration, according to U.S. officials and Syrian figures. The shipments began streaming into the country over the past two weeks, along with separate deliveries by the State Department of vehicles and other gear — a flow of material that marks a major escalation of the U.S. role in Syria’s civil war.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#3 Assad <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/assad-dictates-to-obama-stop-arming-rebels-or-no-deal/article/2535700">is suggesting</a> that the Israelis should give up their weapons of mass destruction.</strong></p>
<p>That is extremely unlikely to happen.</p>
<p><strong>#4 The Syrian &#8220;rebels&#8221; <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/aleppo-rebels-angry-diplomacy-assad">desperately want</a> the U.S. military to intervene in the war in Syria.</strong>  In fact, that was the entire reason <a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/the-un-has-had-evidence-that-syrian-rebels-have-been-using-chemical-weapons-since-may">for the false flag chemical weapon attack</a> in the first place.</p>
<p>The &#8220;top rebel commander&#8221; is now declaring that the Free Syrian Army &#8220;categorically rejects the Russian initiative&#8221;, and he is calling on the United States to strike the Assad regime immediately.</p>
<p><strong>#5 Saudi Arabia desperately wants the U.S. military to intervene in Syria. </strong> The Saudis have spent <a title="billions of dollars" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/is-the-united-states-going-to-go-to-war-with-syria-over-a-natural-gas-pipeline" target="_blank">billions of dollars</a> to support the rebels in Syria, and they have been lobbying very hard for an attack.</p>
<p><strong>#6 Qatar desperately wants the U.S. military to intervene in Syria.</strong>  Qatar has also spent <a title="billions of dollars" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/is-the-united-states-going-to-go-to-war-with-syria-over-a-natural-gas-pipeline" target="_blank">billions of dollars</a> to support the rebels in Syria, and <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2013/09/04/kerry-why-yes-some-arab-countries-have-offered-to-foot-the-entire-bill-if-we-go-do-the-whole-thing-in-syria/">it has been reported</a> that &#8220;Arab countries&#8221; have even offered to pay for all of the costs of a U.S. military operation that would remove Assad.</p>
<p><strong>#7 Turkey has wanted a war which would remove Assad for a very long time.</strong>  And <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/28/world/meast/turkey-syria-tension/index.html">CNN is reporting</a> that Turkey has moved troops to the border with Syria in anticipation of an upcoming attack.</p>
<p><strong>#8 Many members of the U.S. Congress want this war. </strong> Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham are virtually foaming at the mouth, and Robert Menendez, the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that he &#8220;<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/onpolitics/2013/09/12/mccain-putin-syria-op-ed/2803905/">almost wanted to vomit</a>&#8221; after reading Russian President Vladimir Putin’s plea for peace in the New York Times.</p>
<p><strong>#9 Obama does not want to look weak, and he seems absolutely obsessed with starting a war with Syria.</strong>  For the moment, he has been backed into a corner diplomatically by Russia, but the Obama administration is already laying the groundwork for making it look like &#8220;diplomacy has failed&#8221;.  According to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/12/politics/us-syria/">CNN</a>, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is already talking about the &#8220;consequences&#8221; that will happen when the Syria deal falls apart&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Any agreement reached must be &#8220;comprehensive,&#8221; &#8220;verifiable,&#8221; &#8220;credible&#8221; and &#8220;able to be implemented in a timely fashion,&#8221; Kerry said, adding that &#8220;there ought to be consequences if it doesn&#8217;t take place.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#10 There have been reports that U.S. soldiers are now receiving orders to deploy to Syria.</strong>  For example, the following is from a recent article <a href="http://www.infowars.com/venture-capitalist-claims-us-troops-have-received-orders-to-deploy-to-syria/">by Paul Joseph Watson</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Venture capitalist Dan Bubalo claims he was told by a source close to Ft. Hood that US troops have been ordered to deploy to Syria.</p>
<p align="left">Writing for conservative columnist <a href="http://mychal-massie.com/premium/us-troops-receive-orders-to-deploy-to-syria/">Mychal Massie’s website</a>, Bubalo cites a “close and verifiable source” who told him that a friend at Ft. Hood had received news that he was to be sent to Egypt for the next nine months.</p>
<p align="left">“This particular soldier said that while he was not really thrilled about the assignment to Egypt, it was better than the soldiers that remained at the military base BECAUSE THEY HAD JUST RECEIVED THEIR DEPLOYMENT ORDERS TO GO TO SYRIA,” writes Bubalo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to read the original report, you can find it <a href="http://mychal-massie.com/premium/us-troops-receive-orders-to-deploy-to-syria/">right here</a>.</p>
<p>For the moment, Obama and Kerry will dance around and make it look like they are considering peace.  They will try to get Congress to authorize a strike &#8220;if diplomacy fails&#8221;.</p>
<p>But they already know that diplomacy is going to fail.  Once they are ready, Obama will declare that the conditions for war set forth in the congressional authorization have been fulfilled and then he will start raining cruise missiles down on Syria.</p>
<p>When that happens, will Obama have your support?  The video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-sdO6pwVHQ">posted below</a> is one of the funniest that I have seen in a long time&#8230;</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/z-sdO6pwVHQ" height="338" width="450" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>And when Obama does strike Syria, he will officially be allying the United States <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/precious-little-girl-dismembered-while-she-is-still-alive-by-obamas-psychotic-syrian-rebels">with al-Qaeda and other radical jihadist groups</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/11/expert-who-traveled-with-syrian-rebels-so-called-moderates-are-muslim-brotherhood-style-islamists/">Middle Eastern expert Jonathan Spyer</a> has spent a lot of time on the ground among the Syrian rebels recently.  The following is what he has to say about who they are&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Undoubtedly outside of Syria, and in the Syrian opposition structures, there are civilian political activists and leaders who are opposed to al-Qaida and opposed to Islamism,” Spyer explained to TheDC in an email interview. “There are also civilian activists and structures within the country which are opposed to al-Qaida and Islamism. But when one looks at the armed rebel groups, one finds an obvious vast majority there who are adherents of Islamism of one kind or another — stretching from Muslim Brotherhood-type formations all the way across to groups openly aligned with al-Qaida central and with al-Zawahiri.”</p>
<p>“The ‘moderate’ force which we are told about supposedly consists of those rebel brigades aligned with the Supreme Military Command, of Major-General Salim Edriss,” he continued. ”Most of the units aligned with the SMC actually come from a 20-unit strong bloc called the Syrian Islamic Liberation Front. This includes some powerful brigades, such as Liwa al-Islam in the Damascus area, Liwa al Farouq and Liwa al Tawhid. These and the overwhelming majority of the units aligned with the SMC are Islamist formations, who adhere to a Muslim Brotherhood-type outlook.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And as <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/11/20438772-jihadis-gain-ground-in-syrian-rebel-movement-as-moderates-grow-desperate?lite">NBC News</a> recently pointed out, a high percentage of these &#8220;rebels&#8221; have come in from outside Syria&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Abu Abdul Rahman, a 22-year-old from Tunisia, sat in a safe house earlier this week in Antakya &#8212; a southern Turkey town that’s fast becoming a smugglers transit route. He was waiting for a smuggler to take him across the border to fight in Syria.</p>
<p>“Almighty Allah has made Jihad a duty on us. When our Muslim brethren are oppressed, it is a duty to support them wherever they are, because Muslims are not separated by countries,” he said.</p>
<p>Abdul Rahman is one of thousands of al-Qaeda volunteers who are flocking to Syria to join what they see as a battle to defend Muslims no one is bothering to help.</p>
<p>“This was a dream for me, to wage jihad for Allah’s sake, because this is one of the greatest deeds in Islam, to lift aggression off my brothers, to bleed for Allah and no other,” he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this really who Obama intends for us to become &#8220;allies&#8221; with?</p>
<p>Is he insane?</p>
<p>In article after article, I have documented how Obama&#8217;s Syrian rebels have been <a title="slaughtering Christians" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-u-s-military-does-not-want-to-fight-for-al-qaeda-christian-killers-in-syria" target="_blank">ruthlessly murdering Christians</a>, <a title="using chemical weapons" href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/the-un-has-had-evidence-that-syrian-rebels-have-been-using-chemical-weapons-since-may">using chemical weapons</a> and <a title="dismembering little girls" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/precious-little-girl-dismembered-while-she-is-still-alive-by-obamas-psychotic-syrian-rebels" target="_blank">dismembering little girls</a>.</p>
<p>Today, I found an account from a <a href="http://lightbox.time.com/2013/09/12/witness-to-a-syrian-execution-i-saw-a-scene-of-utter-cruelty/#1">Time Magazine reporter</a> that chillingly describes the brutality of these fanatics&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t know how old the victim was but he was young. He was forced to his knees. The rebels around him read out his crimes from a sheet of paper. They stood around him. The young man was on his knees on the ground, his hands tied. He seemed frozen.</p>
<p>Two rebels whispered something into his ear and the young man replied in an innocent and sad manner, but I couldn’t understand what he said because I don’t speak Arabic.</p>
<p>At the moment of execution the rebels grasped his throat. The young man put up a struggle. Three or four rebels pinned him down. The man tried to protect his throat with his hands, which were still tied together. He tried to resist but they were stronger than he was and they cut his throat. They raised his head into the air. People waved their guns and cheered. Everyone was happy that the execution had gone ahead.</p></blockquote>
<p>Should the U.S. military be used to help those jihadist thugs take control of Syria?</p>
<p>If Obama gets us into this war, it has the potential to spin totally out of control very rapidly.</p>
<p>Let us hope and pray that it does not happen.  Because if we do go to war in Syria, it could ultimately lead us down the road to World War III.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong><em>Dear Senator:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I have tried to live by the rules my entire life. My father was a Command Sergeant Major, U.S. Army, who died of combat related stresses shortly after his retirement. It was he who instilled in me those virtues he felt important &#8211; honesty, duty, patriotism and obeying the laws of God and of our various governments. I have served my country, paid my taxes, worked hard, volunteered and donated my fair share of money, time and artifacts.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Today, as I approach my 79th birthday, I am heart-broken when I look at my country and my government. I shall only point out a very few things abysmally wrong which you can multiply by a thousand fold. I have calculated that all the money I have paid in income taxes my entire life cannot even keep the Senate barbershop open for one year! Only Heaven and a few tight-lipped actuarial types know what the Senate dining room costs the taxpayers. So please, enjoy your haircuts and meals on us.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Last year, the president spent an estimated 1.4 $billion on himself and his family. The vice president spends $millions on hotels. They have had 8 vacations so far this year! And our House of Representatives and Senate have become America &#8216;s answer to the Saudi royal family. You have become the &#8220;perfumed princes and princesses&#8221; of our country.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In the middle of the night, you voted in the Affordable Health Care Act, a.k.a. &#8220;Obama Care,&#8221; a bill which no more than a handful of senators or representatives read more than several paragraphs, crammed it down our throats, and then promptly exempted yourselves from it substituting your own taxpayer-subsidized golden health care insurance.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>You live exceedingly well, eat and drink as well as the &#8220;one percenters,&#8221; consistently vote yourselves perks and pay raises while making 3.5 times the average U.S. individual income, and give up nothing while you (as well as the president and veep) ask us to sacrifice due to sequestration (for which, of course, you plan to blame the Republicans, anyway).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>You understand very well the only two rules you need to know &#8211; (1) How to get elected, and (2) How to get re-elected. And you do this with the aid of an eagerly willing and partisan press, speeches permeated with a certain economy of truth, and by buying the votes of the greedy, the ill-informed and under-educated citizens (and non-citizens, too, many of whom do vote ) who are looking for a handout rather than a job. Your so-called &#8220;safety net&#8221; has become a hammock for the lazy. And, what is it now, about 49 or 50 million on food stamps &#8211; pretty much all Democrat voters &#8211; and the program is absolutely rife with fraud with absolutely no congressional oversight?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I would offer that you are not entirely to blame. What changed you is the seductive environment of power in which you have immersed yourselves. It is the nature of both houses of Congress which requires you to subordinate your virtue in order to get anything done until you have achieved a leadership role. To paraphrase President Reagan, it appears that the second oldest profession (politics), bears a remarkably strong resemblance to the oldest.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>As the hirsute first Baron John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton (1834 &#8211; 1902), English historian and moralist, so aptly and accurately stated, &#8220;Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.&#8221; I&#8217;m only guessing that this applies to the female sex as well. Tell me, is there a more corrupt entity in this country than Congress?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>While we middle class people continue to struggle, our government becomes less and less transparent, more and more bureaucratic, and ever so much more dictatorial, using Czars and Secretaries to tell us (just to mention a very few) what kind of light bulbs we must purchase, how much soda or hamburgers we can eat, what cars we can drive, gasoline to use, and what health care we must buy. Countless thousands of pages of regulations strangle our businesses costing the consumer more and more every day.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>As I face my final year, or so, with cancer, my president and my government tell me &#8220;You&#8217;ll just have to take a pill,&#8221; while you, Senator, your colleagues, the president, and other exulted government officials and their families will get the best possible health care on our tax dollars until you are called home by your Creator while also enjoying a retirement beyond my wildest dreams, which of course, you voted for yourselves and we pay for.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The chances of you reading this letter are practically zero as your staff will not pass it on, but with a little luck, a form letter response might be generated by them with an auto signature applied, hoping we will believe that you, our senator or representative, has heard us and actually cares. This letter will, however, go on line where many others will have the chance to read one person&#8217;s opinion, rightly or wrongly, about this government, its administration and its senators and representatives.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I only hope that occasionally you might quietly thank the taxpayer for all the generous entitlements which you have voted yourselves, for which, by law, we must pay, unless, of course, it just goes on the $17 trillion national debt for which your children and ours, and your grandchildren and ours, ad infinitum, must eventually try to pick up the tab.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>My final thoughts are that it must take a person who has either lost his or her soul, or conscience, or both, to seek re-election and continue to destroy this country I deeply love and put it so far in debt that we will never pay it off while your lot improves by the minute, because of your power. For you, Senator, will never stand up to the rascals in your House who constantly deceive the American people. And that, my dear Senator, is how power has corrupted you and the entire Congress. The only answer to clean up this cesspool is term limits. This, of course, will kill the goose that lays your golden eggs. And woe be to him (or her) who would dare to bring it up.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Sincerely,</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Bill Schoonover</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Pretty incredible, eh?</p>
<p>Mr. Schoonover may not get to live through the horror that the full implementation of Obamacare will bring, but most of the rest of us will get to experience it.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/penny-starr/obamacare-regulations-are-8-times-longer-bible">CNSNews.com</a> recently noted, the federal regulations governing Obamacare are already <strong>more than 8 times longer</strong> than the entire Gutenberg Bible.  We are heading toward an unprecedented bureaucratic nightmare&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Since March 2010, when President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and its companion Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (HCERA), the administration has published in the Federal Register 109 final regulations governing how Obamacare will be implemented.</p>
<p><a href="http://cnsnews.com/sites/default/files/documents/Regulation-Spreadsheet%20%283%29.pdf.xls">These regulations</a> add up to 10,516 pages in the Federal Register—or more than eight times as many pages as there are in the <a href="http://lccn.loc.gov/52002339">Gutenberg Bible</a>, which has 642 two-sided leaves or 1,286 pages.</p></blockquote>
<p>And health insurance premiums are already starting to go through the roof at the same time that many Americans are having their hours cut back at work as a result of Obamacare.</p>
<p>We are seeing a fundamental transformation of the workforce, and it is all thanks to Obama.  Billionaire Mort Zuckerman <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2013/09/billionaire-part-timers-will-near-50-of.html">made the following statement</a> on the McLaughlin Group this past weekend&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Part-time employment is going to grow from 25 percent of the workforce to close to 50 percent of the workforce in part because of the problems of healthcare obligations.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you survive on a part-time income?</p>
<p>In the years ahead you might have to.</p>
<p>And of course the Republicans are doing nothing to stop the implementation of Obamacare even though they have had <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/bozell-republicans-have-done-nothing-substance-block-obamacare">opportunity after opportunity</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When the Democrats passed Obamacare, every single Republican in the House and the Senate voted against it. Every single Republican in the House and Senate vowed to do something about it,&#8221; said L. Brent Bozell III, the chairman of ForAmerica.org. He noted that Republicans took control of the House in 2010 by campaigning against Obamacare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sean, the problem is, they have done nothing about it,&#8221; Bozell told Sean Hannity Monday night. And while Republican lawmakers talk about all the things they have done to defund and repeal Obamacare, &#8220;they have done nothing of substance,&#8221; Bozell said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our politicians don&#8217;t want any part of Obamacare themselves, but they are more than happy to force it on the rest of us.</p>
<p>The video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hfP6LmJiSec">posted below</a> is less than 2 minutes long, but I think that it is one of the best videos about Obamacare that I have seen.  I think that you will agree that it is extremely funny&#8230;</p>

<p>Mother Agnes Mariam el-Salib is a Catholic nun and mother superior of St. James Monastery in Qara, Syria.  She has been living in the country for about twenty years, and she has been very active in reporting what has actually been happening on the ground inside Syria.</p>
<p>Posted below is an excerpt from what she <a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/mother-chemical-attack-footage-fraud-509/">told RT</a> the other day.  According to her, the Syrian rebels have been brutally beheading people wherever they go and they even dismembered one little girl with a frame saw <strong>while she was still alive</strong>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>In the village of Estreba they massacred all the residents and burnt down their houses. In the village of al-Khratta almost all the 37 locals were killed. Only ten people were able to escape.</p>
<p>A total of twelve Alawite villages were subjected to this horrendous attack. That was a true slaughterhouse. People were mutilated and beheaded. There is even a video <strong>that shows a girl being dismembered alive – alive! – by a frame saw.</strong> The final death toll exceeded 400, with 150 to 200 people taken hostage. Later some of the hostages were killed, their deaths filmed.</p></blockquote>
<p>What Mother Agnes is saying lines up very well with what is being reported in major international publications such as <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2415586/Syrian-rebels-attack-historic-Christian-village-residents-speak-language-Jesus.html">the Daily Mail</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Terrified Christians claim Syrian rebels ordered them to convert to Islam on pain of death when they ‘liberated’ their ancient village.</p>
<p>Opposition forces, including fighters linked to Al Qaeda, gained temporary control of the Christian village of Maaloula after fighting with regime forces.</p>
<p>The reports have reignited fears about western support for the rebel groups, which are increasingly being infiltrated by Islamic extremists.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to eyewitness accounts quoted in that same article, innocent Christian villagers are being given the choice to either convert on the spot or be summarily executed&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>One Maaloula resident said the rebels, many of whom had beards and shouted ‘Allahu Akbar’ (God is great), attacked Christian homes and churches shortly after moving into the village.</p>
<p>‘They shot and killed people. I heard gunshots and then I saw three bodies lying in the middle of a street in the old quarters of the village. Where is President Obama to see what has befallen us?’</p>
<p>Another Christian resident said: ‘I saw the militants grabbing five villagers and threatening them and saying, “Either you convert to Islam, or you will be beheaded”.’</p></blockquote>
<p>And keep in mind that these psychotic Syrian rebels are doing this <strong>even though they know that the entire world is watching them</strong>.</p>
<p>So if this is how they are acting now, how bad would they be if they actually took power in Syria?</p>
<p>It is also very important to note that a high percentage of these &#8220;rebels&#8221; are actually foreigners.  In fact, as Business Insider reported <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-sent-inmates-against-assad-2013-1">back in January</a>, a lot of them are actually death row inmates that Saudi Arabia set free and sent into Syria to wage jihad&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A leaked internal memo shows how Saudi officials <a href="http://www.aina.org/news/20130120160624.htm">commuted 1,200 death row inmates</a> under the condition they go and fight against Assad in Syria, according to the <span>Assyrian International News Agency.</span></p>
<p>From the memo:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span>We have reached an agreement with them that <strong>they will be exempted from the death sentence</strong> and given a monthly salary to their families and loved ones, who will be prevented from traveling outside Saudi Arabia in return for rehabilitation of the accused and their training <strong>in order to send them to Jihad in Syria.</strong></span></p>
<p>Saudi officials apparently gave them a choice: decapitation or jihad? In total, inmates from <span>Yemen, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Jordan, Somalia, Afghanistan, Egypt, Pakistan, Iraq, and Kuwait chose to go and fight in Syria.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>These are the people that Obama wants to assist?</p>
<p>Is he insane?</p>
<p>If the rebels win, they will set up a hardcore Sunni government that will impose sharia law on the entire nation of Syria.  This is a nation where Christians, Jews and various types of Muslims have been living together peacefully for centuries.</p>
<p>If the jihadists that Obama is supporting win, all of that will be gone.</p>
<p>A similar thing happened in Afghanistan.  We have spent more than a decade &#8220;nation building&#8221; in Afghanistan, and now they have a government where members of parliament argue that anyone that converts to Christianity <a href="http://m.cnsnews.com/news/article/patrick-goodenough/afghan-christian-converts-should-be-executed-afghan-lawmakers-say">should be killed</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Converts from Islam to Christianity should be killed according to Islamic law (shari’a), in a bid to stop the growth of Christianity among Afghans inside and outside the country, according to one leading member of parliament cited by the Afghan Voice Agency news service.</p>
<p>Mohabat News, an independent Iranian Christian news agency, reported on Sunday that Nazir Ahmad Hanafi said several weeks ago that “Afghani citizens continue to convert to Christianity in India. Numerous Afghanis have become Christians in India. This is an offense to Islamic laws and according to the Qur’an they need to be executed.”</p>
<p>Hanafi, an independent who represents the province of Herat, is a prominent lawmaker who heads the parliament’s Legislative Commission and reportedly received the third highest number of votes in the 2010 parliamentary election.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is that what thousands upon thousands of Americans shed their blood for?</p>
<p>Are we about to make <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/deal-or-no-deal-john-kerrys-historic-diplomatic-mistake-proves-that-obama-does-not-want-to-avoid-war">an even worse mistake in Syria?</a></p>
<p>The Syrian rebels are not our friends.  They even put up pictures depicting the destruction of the White House on their Facebook pages.  They are murderous, psychotic jihadists that are the enemy of everything that is true and good.</p>
<p>Please share this article with as many people as you can.  It is so important that we wake as many people up as we can before our government starts a war that it will not be able to stop.</p>

<p><strong>#1</strong> <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/08/27/we-dont-survive-glenn-beck-breaks-down-possible-ramifications-of-u-s-entering-war-in-syria/">Glenn Beck</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is World War III in the making.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#2</strong> <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/08/29/Sen-Cruz-Obama-Ignores-Al-Qaeda-To-Express-Moral-Outrage-From-A-University-Faculty-Lounge">Ted Cruz</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Of nine major rebel groups, seven of them may well have some significant ties to Al Qaeda. And if Assad is toppled and replaced by a radical Islamist regime, what would be truly dangerous for the United States&#8211;for our allies like Israel and Jordan&#8211;is for a radical Islamist government to seize control of [the] chemical weapons and to deploy them, against us or our allies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#3</strong> <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rand-paul-marco-rubio-ted-cruz-weigh-syria/story?id=20112976">Rand Paul</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think the war may escalate out of control. And then we have to ask ourselves who is on America&#8217;s side over there? If the rebels win, will they be American allies?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#4</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sarahpalin">Sarah Palin</a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="userContent"><span class="text_exposed_show">&#8220;We have no clear mission in Syria. There’s no explanation of what vital American interests are at stake there today amidst yet another centuries-old internal struggle between violent radical Islamists and a murderous dictatorial regime, and we have no business getting involved anywhere without one. And where’s the legal consent of the people’s representatives? Our allies in Britain have already spoken. They just said no. The American people overwhelmingly agree, and the wisdom of the people must be heeded.&#8221; </span></span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#5</strong> <a href="http://cnsnews.com/commentary/patrick-j-buchanan/will-boehner-stop-our-rogue-president">Pat Buchanan</a></p>
<blockquote><p>We are told Obama intends to hit Syria with cruise missiles for just a few days to punish Assad and deter any future use of gas, not to topple his regime. After a few hundred missiles and a thousand dead Syrians, presumably, we call it off.</p>
<p>Excuse me, but as Casey Stengel said, &#8220;Can&#8217;t anybody here play this game?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nations that start wars and attack countries, as Gen. Tojo and Adm. Yamamoto can testify, do not get to decide how wide the war gets, how long it goes on or how it ends.</p>
<p>If the United States attacks Damascus and Syria&#8217;s command and control, under the rules of war Syria would be within its rights to strike Washington, the Pentagon and U.S. bases all across the Middle East.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#6</strong> <a href="http://www.infowars.com/bombshell-evidence-syrian-rebels-carried-out-gas-attack/">Dr. Jerome Corsi</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Risking a confrontation with Russia and possibly China is quite frightening and would become one of the most serious moments in U.S. history.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#7</strong> <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/248803/4-over-the-top-warnings-about-attacking-syria">Sean Hannity</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You can almost see this precipitating it, if in fact the U.S. strikes and Iran gets involved and Syria gets involved, and you&#8217;re going to see countries very quickly go down the middle and start taking sides. It has the potential to powder keg.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#8</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0HqCWG171g">Ron Paul</a></p>
<blockquote><p>“Why don’t we ask about the Al Qaeda? Why are we on the side of the Al Qaeda right now?”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#9</strong> <a href="http://www.infowars.com/rand-paul-obama-should-read-constitution-to-avoid-allying-with-al-qaeda/">Mike Huckabee</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Nobody, nobody can claim that Syria is about to drop one [a bomb] on the U.S.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#10</strong> <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/09/rush-syrians-gassed-with-help-from-u-s/">Rush Limbaugh</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Rush Limbaugh today raised the possibility that Syrian rebels were responsible for using chemical weapons on their own people – not President Bashar al-Assad.</p>
<p>Limbaugh said he based the theory on emails he received from friends over the weekend, both of whom “have lived in the Middle East” and “claim to know Bashar.”</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>Limbaugh told listeners he was prepared to brush his friends’ opinions aside until he read <a href="http://www.worldtribune.com/2013/08/28/mounting-evidence-raises-questions-about-syrian-chemical-weapon-attack/">an article by Yossef Bodansky</a>, former director of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, which claims that the chemical weapons attack was carried out by al Qaida terrorists posing as Syrian rebels – and that the U.S. may have had foreknowledge of the attack.</p>
<p>Limbaugh read the first two paragraphs of Bodansky’s World Tribune article on the air:</p>
<p>“There is a growing volume of new evidence from numerous sources in the Middle East – mostly affiliated with the Syrian opposition and its sponsors and supporters – which makes a very strong case, based on solid circumstantial evidence, that the Aug. 21 chemical strike in the Damascus suburbs was indeed a premeditated provocation by the Syrian opposition.</p>
<p>“The extent of U.S. foreknowledge of this provocation needs further investigation because available data puts the ‘horror’ of the Barack Obama White House in a different and disturbing light.”</p>
<p>In other words, Limbaugh explained, “Al Qaida was setting off chemical weapons on their own people … to create the situation where we take Bashir out for them because they can’t do it themselves.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#11</strong> <a href="http://shoebat.com/2013/09/03/obama-an-accessory-to-war-crimes-in-syria/">Walid Shoebat</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If Bodansky’s claims are correct, they will make Gavlak’s story pale in comparison. It will also mean that Barack Obama and any member of Congress who votes to attack Syria will be complicit in war crimes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#12</strong> <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/09/03/matt-drudge-goes-off-on-republican-party-who-are-they/">Matt Drudge</a></p>
<blockquote><p>“Why would anyone vote Republican?” Drudge tweeted. “Please give reason. Raised taxes; marching us off to war again; approved more NSA snooping. WHO ARE THEY?!”</p>
<p>The tweet came after another that was also critical of the GOP. “It’s now Authoritarian vs. Libertarian,” Drudge wrote. “Since Democrats vs. Republicans has been obliterated, no real difference between parties.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking of Drudge, <a href="http://drudgereport.com/">the Drudge report</a> just conducted a poll about war with Syria that received more than half a million responses.  It asked the following question&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>GIVE OBAMA AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT MILITARY OPERATION IN SYRIA?</p></blockquote>
<p>The results were absolutely jaw-dropping&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes: 8.6%</p>
<p>No: 91.4%</p>
<p>Two other more &#8220;scientific&#8221; polls that were released on Tuesday also showed that the American people <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/09/03/obama-syria-poll-pew-abc/2758597/">are overwhelmingly against attacking Syria</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Nearly six in 10 Americans are opposed to using military action as a response to the Syrian government&#8217;s use of chemical weapons in the nation&#8217;s bloody civil war, according to a <i>Washington Post/</i>ABC News poll released Tuesday. A Pew Research Center poll, also released Tuesday afternoon, found that 48% of adults are against military strikes while 29% say they are in favor.</p></blockquote>
<p>So you would think that deciding what to do should be a slam dunk for the Republican leadership in Congress, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Speaker of the House John Boehner has decided to fully support Barack Obama&#8217;s plan to attack Syria.</p>
<p>Not that Obama is going to listen to Congress anyway.  In fact, over the weekend Secretary of State John Kerry repeatedly stated that Obama can strike Syria <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/kerry-obama-attacking-syria-he-has-right-do-no-matter-what-congress">no matter what Congress decides</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>On three national television programs on Sunday, Secretary of State John Kerry repeated an argument President Barack Obama had made on Saturday when Obama announced that he wanted Congress to authorize him to use military force in Syria.</p>
<p>The president does not need authorization from Congress to initiate acts of war, Kerry said.</p>
<p>“He has the right to do that no matter what Congress does,” Kerry said on CNN’s “State of the Union. “That is his right and he asserted that in his comments yesterday.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What in the world is happening to America?</p>
<p>Is there any hope for us?</p>
<p>Fortunately, some Americans are choosing to stand up and be heard.  For example, former anti-war protestor John Kerry is finally <a href="http://www.infowars.com/angry-anti-war-protesters-besiege-john-kerrys-home-banging-on-doors-windows/">getting a taste of his own medicine for once</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>On Sunday, <strong>a</strong><strong>nti-war protestors</strong> protested the anti-war protestor, and with that, as Shakespeare once said, “the wheel is come full circle.”</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Secretary of State <strong>John Kerry</strong> making a forceful case on Friday for U.S. military intervention in <strong>Syria</strong>, protesters assembled outside his townhouse on Beacon Hill.</p>
<p>Yes, the Vietnam veteran who became a leading anti-war activist after serving is now advocating for war.</p>
<p>According to Twitter users, as Twitchy reported, protesters pounded on Kerry’s front door and windows, but he wasn’t home. Of course, past precedent tells us if there is a crisis at hand, Kerry’s likely to be found aboard his 76-foot yacht, the “Isabel.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In the end, the upcoming war with Syria is going to deeply affect all of us.</p>
<p>What the American people want is exceedingly clear.  Barack Obama and the U.S. Congress should listen to us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they don&#8217;t care what we think, and we are all going to end up paying the price for their foolishness.</p>

The message I consistently hear: Please vote no on military action against <a class="twitter-hashtag pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" title="#Syria" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Syria&amp;src=hash" target="_blank" data-query-source="hashtag_click"><s>#</s><b>Syria</b></a>.&#8221;  Of course there are probably a few members of the military that would love a war with Syria, but they appear to be very much in the minority.  Hopefully the Obama administration and members of the U.S. Congress are listening.</p>
<p>Posted below are photos taken from Twitter of American service members publicly declaring that they do not want war with Syria.  In these photos they are wearing their uniforms, but they are obscuring their faces because they could potentially get in a lot of trouble for publicly defying the Obama administration.</p>
<p>We should applaud these brave service members for being willing to publicly take a stand like this&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/soldiers-speak-out-on-syria-we-are-not-a-world-police-2013-9">Business Insider</a> asked members of the military to write to them and tell them what they thought about a potential conflict with Syria.  52 members of the military responded, and 50 of them were against war with Syria.  The following is one example&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a U.S. Air Force vet who spent a solid 6 years shuttling between Afghanistan and Iraq, doing everything from combat airdrops to medevacs to hauling flag-draped coffins,&#8221; wrote one servicemember in an email, who also mentioned travel to 38 countries in that time. &#8220;What we do not need is another war, and we certainly do not need any further involvement in a civil war where our objective isn&#8217;t clear, and our allies aren&#8217;t really our allies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And it is not just the rank and file that are against war with Syria.  According to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-military-officers-have-deep-doubts-about-impact-wisdom-of-a-us-strike-on-syria/2013/08/29/825dd5d4-10ee-11e3-b4cb-fd7ce041d814_story.html">the Washington Post</a>, many among the top military brass are expressing &#8220;serious reservations&#8221; about taking action in Syria&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Obama administration’s plan to launch a military strike against Syria is being received with serious reservations by many in the U.S. military, which is coping with the scars of two lengthy wars and a rapidly contracting budget, according to current and former officers.</p>
<p>Having assumed for months that the United States was unlikely to intervene militarily in Syria, the Defense Department has been thrust onto a war footing that has made many in the armed services uneasy, according to interviews with more than a dozen military officers ranging from captains to a four-star general.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not about being &#8220;anti-war&#8221;.  This is about not wanting to shed American blood in an Islamic civil war where neither side is our friend.</p>
<p>Anyone that believes that the Syrian rebels are the &#8220;good guys&#8221; is being <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-u-s-military-does-not-want-to-fight-for-al-qaeda-christian-killers-in-syria">absolutely delusional</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/us-travel-warning-al-qaeda-affiliated-syrian-rebels-have-claimed">even the U.S. State Department</a> has admitted that the al-Nusra Front is a terror organization that is affiliated with al-Qaeda.  According to the State Department, they have been responsible for close to 600 terror attacks since November 2011&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There is also a threat from terrorism, including groups like al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI) affiliated al-Nusrah Front,&#8221; says <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_5897.html">the current State Department travel warning on Syria</a>. &#8220;Since November 2011, al-Nusrah Front has claimed nearly 600 attacks&#8211;ranging from more than 40 suicide attacks to small arms and improvised explosive device operations&#8212;in major city centers including Damascus, Aleppo, Hamah, Dara, Homs, Idlib, and Dayr al-Zawr. <strong>Public places such as government buildings, shopping areas, and open spaces have been targeted.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The bolded language in this travel warning&#8211;emphasizing that the al Qaeda affiliate fighting in the Syrian opposition has been targeting places such as &#8220;shopping areas&#8221; was put there by the State Department in the online posting of its warning.</p>
<p>&#8220;During these attacks numerous innocent Syrians have been killed,&#8221; then-State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said at <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/12/201759.htm">the department&#8217;s press briefing</a> last Dec. 11.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/05/209499.htm">statement published May 16</a>, the State Department said that Muhammad al-Jawlani, the leader of the al-Nusrah Front, had recently <strong>&#8220;</strong>pledged allegiance to Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qa’ida’s leader.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And even <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/middle-east/syria/120913/al-qaedas-ayman-al-zawahri-calls-muslims-support-syri">the head of al-Qaeda</a> says that the Syrian rebels are working for his side&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>In an audio recording on Thursday, Al Qaeda&#8217;s leader Ayman al-Zawahri announced his support for the beleaguered Syrian rebels.</p>
<p>He framed the Syrian revolution, and the fall of President Bashar al-Assad, as necessary steps towards the defeat of Israel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Supporting jihad in Syria to establish a Muslim state is a basic step towards Jerusalem,&#8221; <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/13/us-alqaeda-zawahri-idUSBRE88C0KT20120913" target="_blank">he said</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why would members of the U.S. military want to go put their lives on the line to help al-Qaeda take over Syria?</p>
<p>Service members would have to be insane to want to go into battle allied with al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>Not a single drop of precious American blood should ever be shed for al-Qaeda.  Unfortunately, the Obama administration seems absolutely determined to make this war happen, and so very soon members of the U.S. military will be forced against their will to fight for the benefit of al-Qaeda in Syria.</p>

<p>But certainly what Miley Cyrus did the other night was a new all-time low.  The following is how her performance was described <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2013/08/27/pops-drop-from-madonna-to-miley/?iid=op-main-lead">by Time Magazine</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Bopping up and down the catwalk in hair-twist devil’s horns and a flesh-colored latex bikini, Cyrus lewdly wagged her tongue, tickled her crotch with a foam finger, shook her buttocks in the air and spanked a 6-ft. 7-in. black burlesque queen.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have not seen her bizarre performance, I do not recommend that you go watch it.  Once you have seen it, it cannot be unseen.</p>
<p>But for parents, one positive that can come out of this is that it can be used as a teaching moment for your children.  In fact, one mother named Kim Keller wrote an open letter to her daughter <a href="http://roadkillgoldfish.com/2013/08/26/dear-daughter-let-miley-cyrus-be-a-lesson-to-you/#comments" target="_blank">on her blog</a> entitled &#8220;Dear daughter, let Miley Cyrus be a lesson to you&#8221; that has gone viral all over the Internet&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, this is what happens when you constantly hear everything you do is awesome. This is what happens when people fawn over your every Tweet and Instagram photo. This is what happens when no responsible adult has ever said the word “no,” made you change your clothes before leaving the house, or never spanked your butt for deliberate defiance.</p>
<p>If you ever even consider doing something like that, I promise you that I will run up and twerk so you will see how ridiculous twerking looks. I will duct tape your mouth shut so your tongue doesn’t hangout like an overheated hound dog. I will smack any male whom you decide to smash against his pelvis – after I first knock you on your butt for forgetting how a lady acts in public.</p>
<p>Why would I do that? Because I love you and I want you to respect yourself. Miley Cyrus is not edgy or cool or sexy. She’s a desperate girl screaming for attention: Notice me. Tell me I’m pretty. See how hot I am. I know all the guys want me. All the girls want to be me.</p>
<p>You probably know girls who will emulate this behavior at the next school dance. Don’t do it with them. You are far too valuable to sell yourself so cheaply. Walk away. Let the boys gawk and know in your heart that they see only a body that can be used for their pleasure and then forgotten.</p></blockquote>
<p>These are the kinds of conversations that mothers should be having with their daughters all over America right now.</p>
<p>And I love how Keller ended the open letter to her daughter&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear daughter, I am going to fight or die trying to keep you from becoming like the Miley Cyruses of the world.</p>
<p>You can thank me later.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have got to fight for our children.</p>
<p>Otherwise, our rapidly decaying culture will absolutely overwhelm them.</p>
<p>The following is how <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2403371/Miley-Cyrus-VMA-performance-The-disturbing-thing-sordid-routine-My-daughters-blas-reaction.html">another mother</a> described what happened when she sat down to watch the video music awards with her daughter&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Sadly, there are no longer many pastimes my teenage daughter, Flo, is prepared to enjoy doing with me. But, thankfully, watching TV together is one of them.</p>
<p>And so I leapt at the opportunity to sit down with her to watch the much- anticipated 2013 MTV Video Music Awards featuring her favourite singers and bands.</p>
<p>How I wish I had done something — anything — else instead. Because what I witnessed had me reaching for the ‘off’ button faster than you can say ‘live streaming’.</p>
<p>I am talking about Miley Cyrus’ jaw-droppingly lewd dance routine — if that’s what you want to call it.</p>
<p>My ten-year old son Monty (who happened to walk through the room just at the moment she stripped down to a nude, latex bikini) probably describes it best.</p>
<p>‘That’s disgusting,’ he proclaimed. ‘Why are you watching lap-dancing?’</p></blockquote>
<p>The rest of the world is watching the filth that is being touted as &#8220;entertainment&#8221; in America today.  As Americans, we like to think that we are setting an &#8220;example&#8221; for the rest of the world, but the only example that we are setting is a bad one.</p>
<p>Is there any hope for our nation as it continues to go down this path?</p>
<p>The problem that we are facing is far, far larger than Miley Cyrus.  Our entire culture is in the process of decaying.  <a href="http://www.prophezine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=837:america-is-gone-what-do-we-do-now-&amp;catid=41:top-headlines">Ray Gano of Prophezine.com</a> put it this way&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><span>I am sickened with Miley for many reasons, but I am thoroughly disgusted with the United States and utter unacceptable filth that is being put out there. </span></p>
<p><span>As I said, Miley is a by-product of a nation gone bad. I look at some of the other pictures and there were hundreds of teenage girls in the audience going crazy over the performance. </span></p>
<p><span>Miley Cyrus was once an innocent girl, she is now the poster child for free and open porn to the masses. </span></p>
<p><span>What saddens me is that she used to claim the title “Christian” and I understand that her family stood on good Christian values. </span></p>
<p><span>Don’t be surprised to hear that Miley will pose for Playboy, Penthouse or produce some smut film in the near future. </span></p>
<p><span>She is leading the pack of young girls down the path of hedonism. </span></p>
<p><span>But what is worse is that this is what our nation wants and demands. </span></p></blockquote>
<p>From a very young age, kids in America are being taught to be highly sexualized, and the results are predictable.  The following statistics are from <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/25-signs-american-women-are-being-destroyed-by-the-sexual-revolution-and-our-promiscuous-culture">one of my previous articles</a>&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> There are <a title="19 million" href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/trends-2011.pdf" target="_blank">19 million</a> new STD infections in the United States <strong>every single year</strong>.  Approximately half of them happen to young people in the 15 to 24-year-old age bracket.</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> It costs the U.S. health care system approximately <a title="$17,000,000,000" href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/trends-2011.pdf" target="_blank">$17,000,000,000</a> every single year to treat sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> There were <a title="more than 1.4 million cases" href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/trends-2011.pdf" target="_blank">more than 1.4 million cases</a> of chlamydia reported in the United States in 2011.  An astounding <a title="33 percent" href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/trends-2011.pdf" target="_blank">33 percent</a> of those cases involved Americans that were younger than 20 years of age.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> It is estimated that about <a title="one out of every six Americans" href="http://www.newswithviews.com/Devvy/kidd570.htm" target="_blank">one out of every six Americans</a> between the ages of 14 and 49 have genital herpes.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> <a title="24,000 American women" href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/trends-2011.pdf" target="_blank">24,000 American women</a> become infertile each year due to undiagnosed STDs.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> In the United States today, approximately <a title="47 percent" href="http://wtop.com/267/2955744/Researchers-report-more-condom-use-among-teenagers" target="_blank">47 percent</a> of all high school students have had sex.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> Sadly, <a title="one out of every four" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-03-11-std_n.htm" target="_blank">one out of every four</a> teen girls in the U.S. has at least one sexually transmitted disease.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> According to one survey, <a title="24 percent" href="http://www.today.com/id/27706917/site/todayshow/ns/today-parenting_and_family/t/survey-unprotected-sex-common-among-teens/#.UP3Ulmec2T5" target="_blank">24 percent</a> of all U.S. teens that have STDs say that they still have unprotected sex.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> Amazingly, <a title="one out of every five" href="http://www.today.com/id/27706917/site/todayshow/ns/today-parenting_and_family/t/survey-unprotected-sex-common-among-teens/#.UP3Ulmec2T5" target="_blank">one out of every five</a> teen girls in the U.S. actually wants to be a teenage mother.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> If you can believe it, the United States has the highest <a title="teen pregnancy rate" href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_tee_pre_sha-health-teenage-pregnancy-share" target="_blank">teen pregnancy rate</a> on the entire planet.  In fact, the United States has a teen pregnancy rate that is more than twice as high as Canada, more than three times as high as France and more than seven times as high as Japan.</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> When men don’t have to wait until they get married to have sex, then they are likely to delay marriage or never get married at all.  According to the Pew Research Center, only <a title="51 percent" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/married-couples-at-a-record-low/2011/12/13/gIQAnJyYsO_story.html" target="_blank">51 percent</a> of all Americans that are at least 18 years old are currently married.  Back in 1960, <a title="72 percent" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/married-couples-at-a-record-low/2011/12/13/gIQAnJyYsO_story.html" target="_blank">72 percent</a> of all U.S. adults were married.</p>
<p><strong>#12</strong> Today, an all-time low <a title="44.2%" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/america-lost-generation-census-2011-9" target="_blank">44.2 percent</a> of all Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are married.</p>
<p><strong>#13</strong> In the United States today, <a title="more than half" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/opinion/sunday/the-downside-of-cohabiting-before-marriage.html?_r=1" target="_blank">more than half</a> of all couples “move in together” before they get married.</p>
<p><strong>#14</strong> The divorce rate for couples that live together first is <a title="significantly higher" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/opinion/sunday/the-downside-of-cohabiting-before-marriage.html?_r=1" target="_blank">significantly higher</a> than for those that do not.</p>
<p><strong>#15</strong> America has the <a title="highest divorce rate" href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/peo_div_rat-people-divorce-rate" target="_blank">highest divorce rate</a> on the globe by a wide margin.</p>
<p><strong>#16</strong> For women under the age of 30 living in the United States today, <a title="more than half of all babies" href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-02-21/home/31081751_1_illegitimacy-black-children-unmarried-women" target="_blank">more than half of all babies</a> are being born out of wedlock.</p>
<p><strong>#17</strong> At this point, <a title="more than one out of every four children" href="http://newsone.com/1195075/children-single-parents-u-s-american/" target="_blank">more than one out of every four children</a> in the United States is being raised by a single parent.</p>
<p><strong>#18</strong> Approximately <a title="42 percent" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2056864/Handout-nation-Food-stamp-map-America-reveals-hotspots-15-population-government-help.html" target="_blank">42 percent</a> of all single mothers in the United States are on food stamps.</p>
<p><strong>#19</strong> The sexual revolution has caused women to be primarily looked at as sex objects.  In this kind of environment, it should be no surprise that there has been an absolute explosion of pornography in recent years.  An astounding <a title="30 percent" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2127201/Porn-site-Xvideos-worlds-biggest-4bn-hits-month-30-web-traffic-porn.html" target="_blank">30 percent</a> of all Internet traffic now goes to pornography websites, and the U.S. produces <a title="more pornography" href="http://techcrunch.com/2007/05/12/internet-pornography-stats/" target="_blank">more pornography</a> than any other nation has in the history of the world.</p>
<p><strong>#20</strong> One survey discovered that <a title="25 percent" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/11/28/the-tangled-web-of-porn-in-the-office.html" target="_blank">25 percent</a> of all employees that have Internet access in America visit sex websites while they are at work.</p>
<p><strong>#21</strong> Overall, <a title="more than 50 million babies" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/more-than-2000-children-are-murdered-in-the-united-states-every-single-day">more than 50 million babies</a> have been killed in America since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973.</p>
<p><strong>#22</strong> When you total up all forms of abortion, including those caused by the abortion drug RU 486, the grand total comes to <a title="more than a million abortions" href="http://www.lifenews.com/2010/11/26/nat-6891/" target="_blank">more than a million abortions</a> performed in the United States every single year.</p>
<p><strong>#23</strong> The number of American babies killed by abortion <strong>each year</strong> <a title="is roughly equal" href="http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=32127" target="_blank">is roughly equal</a> to the number of U.S. military deaths that have occurred in all of the wars that the United States has ever been involved in <strong>combined</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>#24</strong> It has been reported that a staggering 41 percent of all New York City pregnancies <a title="end in abortion" href="http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=7883827" target="_blank">end in abortion</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#25</strong> One study found that <a title="86 percent" href="http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=32127" target="_blank">86 percent</a> of all abortions are done for the sake of convenience.</p>
<p>And as I wrote about <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/public-school-is-one-of-the-most-dangerous-places-you-could-possibly-put-your-children">the other day</a>, our children are certainly not being influenced in the right direction at school either.  In fact, sometimes teachers are some of the worst examples.  For example, it has been reported that <a href="http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2013/08/28/detroit-teachers-moonlight-as-sugar-babies-to-offset-wage-cuts/">more than 200 teachers in Detroit</a> are moonlighting as &#8220;sugar babies&#8221; in order to make some extra income.</p>
<p>As our young people sink even deeper into moral depravity, our culture is encouraging us to become more &#8220;accepting&#8221; of it.  If you can believe it, one recent article in the Huffington Post actually encouraged parents to &#8220;help&#8221; their teens &#8220;<a href="http://www.lifenews.com/2013/08/23/teen-sex-sleepovers-the-latest-fad-in-immoral-sex-education/">have sex well</a>&#8221; with their friends&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Just when I think I’ve heard it all, I come across something that makes me pause in disgust. This week, I read an article from the <i>Huffington Post</i> titled, “How Do You Feel about Sex and Teenage Sleepovers?”<span id="more-58632"></span></p>
<p>There’s no doubt how I feel, but let’s first take a look at what the author said. In the first paragraph she asks, “Why not teach children how to have sex well, the way you teach them how to do other things?” She elaborates, describing parents inviting the teenager’s partner over, having a nice dinner and then the couple “toddles” off to bed together. (In reality, that’s just permitting the behavior to take place, not actually educating.)</p>
<p>Then she goes further stating, “It seems logical to me that the same way I try to teach my kids to exercise, sleep well and be good people, I would teach them to have healthy sex with other good people.” Appalling mental scenarios come to mind, but I’m not going there.</p></blockquote>
<p>What in the world is happening to America?</p>
<p>Is there any hope for this country?</p>

<p>When it comes to their children, safety is the number one priority for most parents.  They expect that their children will be kept safe going to school, while they are at school, and coming home from school.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, school is becoming an increasingly dangerous place to be for our children.  And I am not just talking about the mass shootings that have happened in recent years.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/260-school-children-killed-chicago-3-years-where-are-tears-them">260 school children</a> have been killed in the city of Chicago alone over the past three years, and now things are about to get even worse.  The following is an excerpt from a <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2013/08/incredible-rahmaland-braces-for-first.html">recent article</a> about the impact that budget cuts and school closings are having on school safety in Chicago&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of Chicago’s cuts have taken place in the predominantly poor, African-American and Latino south and west sides, which is also where the majority of the city’s record 506 murders occurred last year.</p>
<p>The city has created 600 “safe passage” routes manned by adults and meant to try to ensure the safety of students crossing gang territories. But in recent weeks at least two people have been killed on those paths. One incident saw four injured and one dead after a shooting in front of a church. Another saw a 54-year-old man shot on the safe passage route that leads to Drake Elementary in Bronzeville.</p>
<p>Lillian Allen, a mother of two students at Drake, said the violence was “nerve-racking”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Annie Stoball will on Monday walk her nine-year-old granddaughter Kayla four blocks to her first day at Chicago’s Gresham Elementary, traversing the territory of two different gangs. She felt much safer taking Kayla across the street to Morgan Elementary.</p>
<p>The grandmother said: “This is dangerous. We’re going right into the heart of the gangs.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In recent years, the number of gang members in the city of Chicago has absolutely exploded.  It is estimated that there are now <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/perhaps-we-wouldnt-mind-illegal-immigrants-so-much-if-they-didnt-commit-so-many-horrible-crimes">approximately 100,000 gang members</a> living in the city, and not even the &#8220;safe passage&#8221; routes for school children <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/22158887-418/safe-passage-routes-put-to-test-amid-more-shootings.html">are safe now</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="body.text">The eyes of the city were on Chicago Public Schools “Safe Passage” routes Monday morning as a 28-year-old man was shot along one of the routes and a 14-year-old boy was shot to death near another one, the day before school starts.</p>
<p class="body.text">The 14-year-old boy was shot and killed within a block of a welcoming elementary school, Melody Stem School , 3937 W. Wilcox. It’s at least the third fatal shooting along or near a Safe Passage route since mid-August.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="body.text">In other areas of the country, gang activity is not a major problem yet, but concern about school violence is still a huge issue.</p>
<p class="body.text">The state of Connecticut has one of the highest per capita incomes in the entire country, but the mass shooting that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School less than a year ago has caused schools all over the state <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-school-security-0825-20130825,0,1906279.story">to adopt extreme security measures</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="body.text">In Enfield, each of the town&#8217;s 14 public and parochial schools will have an armed guard at the door when they open for the year Sept. 3. Enfield Police Chief Carl Sferrazza said he believes armed guards are the best deterrent for an &#8220;active shooter&#8221; like <span class="taxInlineTagLink">Adam Lanza</span> in Newtown.</p>
<p class="body.text">&#8220;These people are homicidal and suicidal individuals. Their intent and their planning is all geared toward killing as many people as they possibly can,&#8221; Sferrazza said.</p>
<p>All Glastonbury schools also will have guards at the doors when school starts Aug. 29. The high school and Smith Middle School already had guards stationed there, and the town added seven additional guards at a cost of $315,000 for the school year.</p>
<p>Other school districts have chosen to add cameras, door buzzers, card-swipe entry systems or other, less drastic, security measures.</p></blockquote>
<p>But sometimes it is actually the &#8220;security officials&#8221; that end up brutalizing the kids.  The following are just a couple of examples of the kinds of things that happen in public schools in America every single day&#8230;</p>
<p>*A security thug at one school in California actually fractured the arm of one 16-year-old girl because <a title="she left some crumbs on the floor" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk2b_twCCdw" target="_blank">she left some crumbs on the floor</a> after cleaning up some cake that she had spilled.</p>
<p>*In Allentown, Pennsylvania a 14-year-old girl <a title="was tasered in the groin area" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaPjJG8NVsY&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">was tasered in the groin area</a> by a school security thug even though she had put up her hands in the air to surrender to him.</p>
<p>And if your kid does something to be considered a &#8220;security threat&#8221;, he or she could be taken out of school in handcuffs and hauled off to prison or to a mental institution.  The following examples are <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/10-disgusting-examples-of-very-young-school-children-being-arrested-handcuffed-and-brutalized-by-police">from one of my previous articles</a>&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> At an elementary school in Baltimore recently, three nine-year-old girls and an eight-year-old boy were arrested for fighting and marched out of their elementary school in handcuffs.  The police department <a title="is defending" href="http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2012/03/30/baltimore-police-handcuff-arrest-4-children-under-age-10-at-their-school/" target="_blank">defended</a> handcuffing those kids….</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s our policy, regardless of the age, when a suspect is arrested by police, they’re handcuffed. And the reason is just not for the suspect’s safety but also for officers’ safety,” Det. Jeremy Silbert of the Baltimore City Police Department said.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#2</strong> In New Haven, Connecticut a 10-year-old boy was actually arrested by police for giving another student “<a title="a wedgie" href="http://ctwatchdog.com/education/hundreds-of-ct-inner-city-school-children-arrested-yearly-on-minor-issues" target="_blank">a wedgie</a>” on a school bus.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> Just last year, a 5-year-old boy at a public school in Stockton, California was arrested by police and handcuffed with zip ties because he was committing &#8220;<a title="battery on a police officer" href="http://www.kcra.com/r/29847063/detail.html" target="_blank">battery on a police officer</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>How much damage can a 5-year-old kid really do to a police officer?</p>
<p>The boy was ultimately sent to a hospital and forced to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> A 6-year-old girl down in Florida was &#8220;<a title="throwing objects, hitting administration personnel and screaming uncontrollably" href="http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2010/feb/11/port-st-lucie-schools-confines-6-year-old-with/" target="_blank">throwing objects, hitting administration personnel and screaming uncontrollably</a>&#8221; so police handcuffed the 40 pound little girl and shipped her off to a mental institution for evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> In San Mateo, California a few months ago a 7-year-old special education student was blasted in the face <a title="with pepper spray" href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/12/08/MNH91M90CN.DTL" target="_blank">with pepper spray</a> because he would not quit climbing on the furniture.  Police were then able to subdue the boy and he was &#8220;committed for a psychiatric evaluation&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> Down in Florida, an 11-year-old student was arrested by police, thrown in jail and charged with a third-degree felony for bringing <a title="a plastic butter knife" href="http://www.eagleforum.org/educate/2009/june09/zero-tolerance-states.html" target="_blank">a plastic butter knife</a> to school.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> In Texas, a 12-year-old girl was recently arrested by police <a title="for spraying herself with perfume" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/09/texas-police-schools" target="_blank">for spraying two bursts of perfume on her neck</a>.  She was formally charged with a misdemeanor.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> A 13-year-old boy at a public school in Albuquerque, New Mexico was recently arrested by police <a title="for burping in class" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57334925/student-arrested-for-burping-lawsuit-claims/" target="_blank">for burping in class</a>.  The police marched him out of school and hauled him over to a juvenile detention center.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> Back in 2010, a 12-year-old girl at a school in Forest Hills, New York wrote &#8220;<a title="I love my friends Abby and Faith" href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/02/18/new.york.doodle.arrest/index.html?hpt=C1" target="_blank">I love my friends Abby and Faith</a>&#8221; on her desk.  The police were called out and she was marched out of her school in handcuffs in front of all her friends.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> A teenage couple down in Houston, Texas poured milk on each other during a squabble while they were breaking up a while back.  Instead of being sent to see the principal, <a title="they were arrested" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/09/texas-police-schools" target="_blank">they were arrested by police</a> and sent to court.</p>
<p>Of course these days virtually no place is safe for young children.  If you take your eyes off of them for even a moment they could be taken by predators.</p>
<p class="body.text">For instance, just check out what just happened <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/man-kill-girl-best-buy-bathroom-sheriff-article-1.1437010">at a Best Buy down in Florida</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A Florida man tried to kill a 9-year-old girl in a Best Buy bathroom, jamming a plastic bag over her head and stuffing her face in a toilet before employees intervened, authorities said.</p>
<p>Another customer heard the girl screaming and crying inside the women&#8217;s restroom at the Jacksonville store and notified store staff. An employee looked under the stall and discovered a horrific scene.</p>
<p>James Tadros, 29, had kicked and beaten the girl bloody and was forcing her head inside the toilet, the Jacksonville Sheriff&#8217;s Office said in a statement.</p></blockquote>
<p>But physical violence is not the only threat that parents need to be concerned about.  If you allow your children to go to public schools or if you allow them to get into the &#8220;wrong crowd&#8221;, there is a very high probability that they could be sexually corrupted or sexually violated.  The following examples are from one of my previous articles entitled &#8220;<a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/21-signs-that-u-s-public-schools-have-become-training-centers-for-sexual-deviancy">21 Signs That U.S. Public Schools Have Become Training Centers For Sexual Deviancy</a>&#8220;&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> There is a raging epidemic of sexually-transmitted diseases among our young people.  According to the latest figures released by <span>the U.S. Centers for Disease Control</span>, there are <span><a title="20 million" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2278457/CDC-warns-Valentines-Day-eve-severe-epidemic-sexually-transmitted-diseases-sweeping-nation.html" target="_blank">20 million</a> new sexually-transmitted infections</span> in the United States every single year, and Americans between the ages of 15 and 24 account for <a title="approximately 50 percent" href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2013/02/14/cdc-warns-of-super-gonorrhea/" target="_blank">approximately 50 percent</a> of those new sexually-transmitted infections.</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> Many of our teens are catching diseases that they can’t even pronounce correctly.  There were <a title="more than 1.4 million cases" href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/trends-2011.pdf" target="_blank">more than 1.4 million cases</a> of chlamydia reported in the United States in 2011.  An astounding <a title="33 percent" href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/trends-2011.pdf" target="_blank">33 percent</a> of those cases involved Americans that were younger than 20 years of age.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> At this point, <a title="one out of every four" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-03-11-std_n.htm" target="_blank">one out of every four</a> teen girls in the U.S. has at least one sexually transmitted disease.  How high does that number have to go before we admit that there is a problem?</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> Apparently, all of the propaganda about “safe sex” is not really working very well.  According to one survey, <a title="24 percent" href="http://www.today.com/id/27706917/site/todayshow/ns/today-parenting_and_family/t/survey-unprotected-sex-common-among-teens/#.UP3Ulmec2T5" target="_blank">24 percent</a> of all U.S. teens that have an STD say that they still have unprotected sex.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> When you take morality out of public life, the results are predictable.  In the United States today, approximately <a title="47 percent" href="http://wtop.com/267/2955744/Researchers-report-more-condom-use-among-teenagers" target="_blank">47 percent</a> of all high school students have had sex.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> Many of our young people seem to not understand the value of waiting until marriage to become a mother.  Amazingly, <a title="one out of every five" href="http://www.today.com/id/27706917/site/todayshow/ns/today-parenting_and_family/t/survey-unprotected-sex-common-among-teens/#.UP3Ulmec2T5" target="_blank">one out of every five</a> teen girls in the U.S. actually wants to be a teenage mother.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> When I was growing up, I don’t remember a single girl being pregnant at my high school.  But today all of that has changed.  A couple of years ago it was being reported that <a title="86 teen girls" href="http://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/01/14/teens-pregnant-menphis-high-school/" target="_blank">86 teen girls</a> at one high school in Memphis, Tennessee were either pregnant or had recently given birth.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> If you can believe it, the United States has the highest <a title="teen pregnancy rate" href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_tee_pre_sha-health-teenage-pregnancy-share" target="_blank">teen pregnancy rate</a> on the entire planet.  In fact, the United States has a teen pregnancy rate that is more than twice as high as Canada, more than three times as high as France and more than seven times as high as Japan.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> Increasingly, oral sex is being promoted to our young people as a “safer” form of sex.  According to shocking research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <a title="approximately two-thirds" href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/story/2012-08-16/cdc-oral-sex/57079768/1?csp=hf" target="_blank">approximately two-thirds</a> of all Americans in the 15 to 24 year old age bracket have engaged in oral sex.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> Sex “education” has become much more about “indoctrination” in recent years.  One recent example of this trend was detailed <a title="in the New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/opinion/does-sex-ed-undermine-parental-rights.html?_r=1" target="_blank">in the New York Times</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p>IMAGINE you have a 10- or 11-year-old child, just entering a public middle school. How would you feel if, as part of a class ostensibly about the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, he and his classmates were given “risk cards” that graphically named a variety of solitary and mutual sex acts? Or if, in another lesson, he was encouraged to disregard what you told him about sex, and to rely instead on teachers and health clinic staff members?</p>
<p>That prospect would horrify most parents. But such lessons are part of a middle-school curriculum that Dennis M. Walcott, the New York City schools chancellor, has recommended for his system’s newly mandated sex-education classes. There is a parental “opt out,” but it is very limited, covering classes on contraception and birth control.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#11</strong> Sexual “experimentation” among our teens is reaching heights never seen before.  According to <a title="one recent study" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2078369/Sexual-activity-teenage-girls-higher-claims-new-research.html" target="_blank">one recent study</a>, sexual contact between teen girls in the United States is now at the highest level ever recorded.</p>
<p><strong>#12</strong> In America today, sex in public school hallways has become a common occurrence.  In a <a title="recent article about Detroit" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/bankrupt-decaying-and-nearly-dead-24-facts-about-the-city-of-detroit-that-will-shock-you" target="_blank">recent article about Detroit</a>, I shared a quote from one of my readers that actually attended one of the “best” public schools in Detroit…</p>
<blockquote><p>The school was a new seven story building just a couple of years old. The bathrooms would often lack toilet paper &amp; soap beyond the second floor (the main floor), the bathroom sinks would often not work. The water fountains on north side of the building on from the third floor &amp; up did not work. The elevators would constantly break down. I even got stuck on the elevator before. I almost tripped down a half a flight of stairs because the elastic seal (it was the metal bar at the front of a treader of I don’t know the name of it.) the stairs was not properly installed.</p>
<p>Students would often have sex on the stairs &amp; throughout the school. Parents actually called the school many times &amp; reported kids having sex on the stairs because all of them had glass windows 270 degrees.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#13</strong> Would you feel okay about your teenage girl sharing a bathroom with boys?  In <a title="the state of Massachusetts" href="http://christiannews.net/2013/02/17/massachusetts-education-policy-mandates-allowing-boys-in-girls-restrooms/" target="_blank">the state of Massachusetts</a>, boys will now be able to freely use girls restrooms and girls locker rooms if it makes them feel more “comfortable”.</p>
<p><strong>#14</strong> One of the results of our “culture of sex” has been an explosion in the number of babies being born outside of marriage.  For women under the age of 30 living in the United States today, <a title="more than half of all babies" href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-02-21/home/31081751_1_illegitimacy-black-children-unmarried-women" target="_blank">more than half of all babies</a> are being born out of wedlock.</p>
<p><strong>#15</strong> Being a single parent is incredibly hard, but more U.S. children are being raised by just one parent than ever before.  At this point, <a title="more than one out of every four children" href="http://newsone.com/1195075/children-single-parents-u-s-american/" target="_blank">more than one out of every four children</a> in the United States is being raised by a single parent.</p>
<p><strong>#16</strong> Thanks to our “sexual revolution”, men and women are having a harder time than ever relating to each other in a meaningful way.  Our young people are being taught that marriage is a “burden” and that they should delay it for as long as possible.  Today, an all-time low <a title="44.2%" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/america-lost-generation-census-2011-9" target="_blank">44.2 percent</a> of all Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are married.</p>
<p><strong>#17</strong> There is an epidemic of sex between teachers and students in the United States.  In fact, for some teachers one student is just simply not enough.  For example, a 33-year-old art teacher down in Arizona was charged with having sex <a title="with four of her male students" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/21/melissa-dalton-teacher_n_1533664.html?icid=maing-grid10%7Chtmlws-main-bb%7Cdl15%7Csec1_lnk2%26pLid%3D162796" target="_blank">with four of her male students</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#18</strong> A former high school English teacher down in Texas has that teacher beat.  She has been accused of having sex <a title="with five different male students" href="http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/teacher-accused-having-group-sex-students-video-134339076--abc-news-topstories.html" target="_blank">with five different male students</a>.  The most disturbing part of her story is that she is a mother of three children and her husband is serving this country in the U.S. Army.</p>
<p><strong>#19</strong> But a high school teacher down in Georgia has both of them beat.  She was recently charged with having sex <a title="with seven of her students" href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/30/justice/georgia-teacher-arrested/" target="_blank">with seven of her students</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#20</strong> Sometimes even teachers that have been <strong>convicted</strong> of having sex with a student cannot stop themselves.  For example, there was one case where a probation officer found a student that a teacher had been convicted of having sex with previously hiding <a title="in her closet" href="http://www.necn.com/03/12/12/Teacher-who-had-relationship-with-studen/landing_newengland.html?blockID=668408&amp;feedID=4206" target="_blank">in her closet</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p>Lisa Lavoie, the former Holyoke teacher who plead guilty after having a relationship with a student, has been charged with violating her probation after the student she had a relationship with was found hiding in her closet.</p>
<p>Back in February 2009, Lavoie ran off with one of her students, who was 15-year-old at the time. Lavoie was a teacher at the Donahue School on Whiting Farms Road in Holyoke.</p>
<p>The pair was found several days later in a motel room in West Virginia. Lavoie pleaded guilty to three counts of statutory rape and one count of enticement of a child in January 2011. She was sentenced to five years probation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, our young people don&#8217;t have much of a chance with role models <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/08/26/miley-cyrus-vmas-twitter/2699021/">such as Miley Cyrus</a> running around.</p>
<p>The fabric of society is coming apart at the seams, and our public schools have become cesspools of corruption, sex and violence.</p>
<p>So in light of everything that you have just read, can you think of any good reason why parents should send their children to public schools?</p>

<p>The truth is that China is not like us and they <strong>never</strong> intend to be.  The Chinese people do not get to choose their leaders in free elections, and the Communist Party in China never intends to allow that to happen.</p>
<p>The Chinese people do not have freedom of speech or freedom of religion, and the Communist Party in China never intends to give the general population those freedoms.</p>
<p>In most cases, Chinese families do not even have the freedom to have more than one child, and if a Chinese family tries to buck the system a mobile abortion van may show up at their front door.</p>
<p>The Chinese system is horribly repressive, and in many ways it continues to get even worse.</p>
<p>And officials in China definitely do not consider the United States to be a &#8220;partner&#8221;.  Rather, they consider the United States to be a rival that needs to be vanquished.</p>
<p>This attitude comes through very clearly in a Chinese government memo known as &#8220;Document No. 9&#8243; that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/world/asia/chinas-new-leadership-takes-hard-line-in-secret-memo.html?_r=2&amp;">New York Times</a> was recently able to get a copy of&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Communist Party cadres have filled meeting halls around China to hear a somber, secretive warning issued by senior leaders. Power could escape their grip, they have been told, unless the party eradicates seven subversive currents coursing through Chinese society.</p>
<p>These seven perils were enumerated in a memo, referred to as Document No. 9, that bears the unmistakable imprimatur of Xi Jinping, China’s new top leader. The first was “Western constitutional democracy”; others included promoting “universal values” of human rights, Western-inspired notions of media independence and civic participation, ardently pro-market “neo-liberalism,” and “nihilist” criticisms of the party’s traumatic past.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Document No. 9&#8243; sounds very similar to another &#8220;anti-western Communist Party document&#8221; that was reported on earlier this year in the Sunday Times <a href="http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/Asia/article1261311.ece">by Michael Sheridan</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A hostile anti-western Communist Party document circulating among hundreds of Chinese officials has given the first proof that Xi’s leadership is set on a hard line against liberal foreign influences.</p>
<p>It tells officials they must “completely understand the harm of viewpoints and theories propagated by the West” and emphasises the need for China to “stand up against the West” by becoming rich and strong.</p>
<p>The communist faithful are exhorted to strengthen their leadership, to be “relentless” in political guidance and to “use battlefield tactics” to defeat liberals and dissidents.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are you starting to get the picture?</p>
<p>China has no intention of becoming more like us.  In fact, Chinese officials hate our liberties and our freedoms.</p>
<p>And the Chinese military actually considers the United States to be their &#8220;enemy-in-chief&#8221;.  That is exactly how the U.S. is described in a recent paper which was drafted <a href="http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/wrm/2013/04/16/chinese-us-militaries-best-bros-or-great-enemies/">by the PLA&#8217;s deputy chief of staff</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>China’s military considers the United States “enemy-in-chief” and, as it has done for decades, maintains a shroud of secrecy around the PLA’s size, capabilities, and intentions. That much is clear from a <a href="http://www.cna.org/sites/default/files/research/DQR-2013-U-004445-Final.pdf">recent paper</a> written by the PLA’s deputy chief of the general staff, the number two military man in China, for the <em>Study Times</em>, the official newspaper of the Communist Party School.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, some top military officials in China have even advocated using nuclear weapons against the United States first in the event of a military conflict between our two countries&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Gen. Zhu Chenghu expressed willingness to abandon China&#8217;s &#8220;no first use&#8221; nuclear weapons policy, to defend its claim over Taiwan and argued that China should use nuclear weapons against the United States should its military interfere. A 2011 editorial in the Global Times (an English edition of the Communist Party of China&#8217;s official newspaper) <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/NEWS/tabid/99/ID/680694/Dont-take-peaceful-approach-for-granted.aspx" target="_blank">warned that countries</a> involved in sea disputes with China &#8220;need to prepare for the sounds of cannons.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For now, China is content to trade with us because it benefits them.  Chinese officials consider every interaction with the west to be part of a grand game of chess which is marching toward an inevitable conclusion, and they very much plan on being the victors.</p>
<p>And without a doubt, China is defeating the United States on a whole host of fronts right now.  The following examples are from one of my previous articles entitled &#8220;<a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/40-ways-that-china-is-beating-america">40 Ways That China Is Beating America</a>&#8220;&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> When you total up all imports and exports of goods, China is now <a title="the number one trading nation" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-09/china-passes-u-s-to-become-the-world-s-biggest-trading-nation.html" target="_blank">the number one trading nation</a> on the entire planet.</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> During 2012, we sold about <a title="110 billion dollars" href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html" target="_blank">110 billion dollars</a> worth of stuff to the Chinese, but they sold about <a title="425 billion dollars" href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html" target="_blank">425 billion dollars</a> worth of stuff to us.  That was the largest trade deficit that one nation has had with another nation in the history of the world.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> Overall, the U.S. has run a trade deficit with China over the past decade that comes to <a title="more than 2.3 trillion dollars" href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html" target="_blank">more than <strong>2.3 trillion</strong> dollars</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> China now has the <a title="largest new car market" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-09/china-passes-u-s-to-become-the-world-s-biggest-trading-nation.html" target="_blank">largest new car market</a> in the entire world.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> China has <a title="more foreign currency reserves" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-09/china-passes-u-s-to-become-the-world-s-biggest-trading-nation.html" target="_blank">more foreign currency reserves</a> than anyone else on the planet.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> China is the <a title="number one gold producer" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-02-10/guest-post-china-surpasses-us-number-one-global-trading-power" target="_blank">number one gold producer</a> in the world.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> China is also the <a title="number one gold importer" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-02-10/guest-post-china-surpasses-us-number-one-global-trading-power" target="_blank">number one gold importer</a> in the world.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> The uniforms for the U.S. Olympic team were <a title="made in China" href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/07/americas-olympic-uniforms-are-still-made-china/54449/" target="_blank">made in China</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> 85 percent of all artificial Christmas trees <a title="are made in China" href="http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/countries/china-quiz/" target="_blank">are made in China</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> The <a title="new World Trade Center tower" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/new-world-trade-center-tower-to-be-made-with-glass-from-china-and-steel-from-germany" target="_blank">new World Trade Center tower</a> is going to include glass that has been imported from China.</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> The new Martin Luther King memorial on the National Mall <a title="was also made in China" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8715823/Martin-Luther-King-memorial-made-in-China.html" target="_blank">was made in China</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#12</strong> One of the reasons it is so hard to export stuff to China is because of their tariffs.  According to <a title="the New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/business/global/china-imposes-new-tariffs-on-some-vehicles-from-the-us.html?_r=1" target="_blank">the New York Times</a>, a Jeep Grand Cherokee that costs $27,490 in the United States costs about $85,000 in China thanks to all the tariffs.</p>
<p><strong>#13 </strong>The Chinese economy has grown <a title="7 times faster" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/facts-about-china-blow-your-mind-2011-5#chinas-economy-grew-7-times-as-fast-as-americas-over-the-past-decade-316-growth-vs-43-2" target="_blank">7 times faster</a> than the U.S. economy has over the past decade.</p>
<p><strong>#14</strong> The United States has lost <a title="a&amp;nbsp;staggering 32 percent" href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_plight_of_american_manufacturing" target="_blank">a staggering 32 percent</a> of its manufacturing jobs since the year 2000.</p>
<p><strong>#15</strong> The United States has lost an average of 50,000 <a title="manufacturing jobs" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/how-can-america-create-wealth-if-our-industrial-base-is-destroyed-50000-manufacturing-jobs-have-been-lost-every-month-since-2001" target="_blank">manufacturing jobs</a> per month since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.</p>
<p><strong>#16</strong> Overall, the United States has lost a total of <a title="more than 56,000" href="http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/nov/07/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-says-average-15-us-factories-close-ea/" target="_blank">more than 56,000</a> manufacturing facilities since 2001.</p>
<p><strong>#17</strong> According to the Economic Policy Institute, America is losing <a title="half a million jobs" href="http://economyincrisis.org/content/trade-deficit-china-could-cost-half-million-jobs" target="_blank">half a million jobs</a> to China every single year.</p>
<p><strong>#18</strong> China now produces <a title="more than twice as many" href="http://247wallst.com/2012/01/24/eight-industries-the-u-s-has-lost-to-china/3/" target="_blank">more than twice as many</a> automobiles as the United States does.</p>
<p><strong>#19</strong> Since the auto industry bailout, approximately <a title="70 percent" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/you-will-not-believe-what-some-people-are-willing-to-do-for-a-paycheck-these-days" target="_blank">70 percent</a> of all GM vehicles have been built outside the United States.</p>
<p><strong>#20</strong> After being bailed out by U.S. taxpayers, General Motors is currently involved in <a title="11 joint ventures" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lvl5Gan69Wo&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">11 joint ventures</a> with companies owned by the Chinese government.  The price for entering into many of these “joint ventures” was a transfer of “<a title="state of the art technology" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lvl5Gan69Wo&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">state of the art technology</a>” from General Motors to the communist Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>#21 </strong>Back in 1998, the United States had 25 percent of the world’s high-tech export market and China had just 10 percent. Ten years later, the United States had less than 15 percent and China’s share had <a title="soared to  20 percent" href="http://www.economyincrisis.org/content/us-falling-behind-china-high-tech-manufacturing" target="_blank">soared to 20 percent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#22</strong> The United States has lost <a title="more than a quarter" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/us-losing-high-tech-manufacturing-jobs-to-asia/2012/01/17/gIQA9P1S6P_story.html" target="_blank">more than a quarter</a> of all of its high-tech manufacturing jobs over the past ten years.</p>
<p><strong>#23 </strong>China’s number one export to the U.S. is <a title="computer equipment" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/clyde-prestowitz/america-needs-a-new-globa_b_557131.html" target="_blank">computer equipment</a>, but the number one U.S. export to China is <a title="&quot;scrap and trash&quot;" href="http://politics.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/jodie-allen/2010/3/3/americas-biggest-trade-export-to-china-trash.html" target="_blank">“scrap and trash”</a>.</p>

<p><strong>#30</strong> Today, China produces <a title="nearly twice as much beer" href="http://247wallst.com/2012/01/24/eight-industries-the-u-s-has-lost-to-china/3/" target="_blank">nearly twice as much beer</a> as the United States does.</p>

<p><strong>#37</strong> 15 years ago, China was 14th in the world in published scientific research articles.  But now, China is expected <a title="to pass the United States" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/mar/28/china-us-publisher-scientific-papers" target="_blank">to pass the United States</a> and become number one very shortly.</p>
<p><strong>#38</strong> China now awards <a title="more doctoral degrees in engineering" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/us-losing-high-tech-manufacturing-jobs-to-asia/2012/01/17/gIQA9P1S6P_story.html" target="_blank">more doctoral degrees in engineering</a> each year than the United States does.</p>
<p><strong>#39</strong> The average household debt load in the United States is 136% of average household income.  In China, the average household debt load <a title="is 17%" href="http://blogs.forbes.com/moneybuilder/2010/06/24/one-big-difference-between-chinese-and-american-households-debt/" target="_blank">is 17%</a> of average household income.</p>
<p><strong>#40</strong> The Chinese have begun to buy up huge amounts of U.S. real estate.  In fact, Chinese citizens purchased <a title="one out of every ten homes" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVSJOPG745M" target="_blank">one out of every ten homes</a> that were sold in the state of California in 2011.</p>
<p>Sadly, most of the people that will end up reading this article will not take it seriously.</p>
<p>In fact, there will inevitably be quite a few comments left after this article mocking the idea that China considers us to be &#8220;the enemy&#8221;.</p>
<p>A lot of Americans have been deluded into thinking that China &#8220;needs us&#8221; and that they always will.  But that is not how the Chinese think.  Once they have extracted as much wealth and technology from us as they want, they will have no problem turning on us.</p>
<p>The Chinese truly believe that their system is superior to ours and that they will win in the end.  Most Americans will never understand this until it is far too late.</p>

<p>I was absolutely stunned when I first heard about this new agreement.  How in the world can the U.S. government promise to assist illegal immigrants in the workplace?  This deal probably breaks a whole bunch of existing immigration laws, but nobody is doing anything about it.  The following is an excerpt <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/8-8-13.cfm">from the press release about this new deal</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Miami District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) entered into a Memorandum of  Understanding (MOU) in Orlando today with the Consulate General of Mexico in  Miami and Consulate of Mexico in Orlando.  The agreement establishes an ongoing collaboration between these  entities to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance, and access to  resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace <strong>regardless of immigration status</strong>.  Mexican Consul Efran Nicolas Leyva Acevedo of Orlando and Miami District Office Director Malcolm S. Medley signed the agreement.  Acting  Mexican Consul General Vladimir Hernandez Lara of Miami signed the document  prior to the meeting today.</p>
<p>&#8220;By signing this Memorandum of Understanding today with the Mexican Consulate, we of the EEOC&#8217;s  Miami District have solidified our continued and longstanding commitment to this underserved community,&#8221; said Medley.  &#8220;This agreement provides the opportunity for on­going education, outreach and service  by the EEOC to Mexican nationals in our area.  We look forward to a long-lasting and significant partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the terms of the MOU, the EEOC will expand its relationship with these two consulates by providing them with Spanish-language materials explaining the laws enforced by the federal agency.  In addition, the EEOC will partner with consulate  offices to provide information and training to areas of the state where migrant farm workers and other Mexican nationals live and work.</p></blockquote>
<p>And of course this comes at a time of <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/category/unemployment">high unemployment</a> for U.S. citizens and at a time when wages are being driven down by competition from illegal immigrants inside this country and by competition from foreign workers overseas.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Obama administration does not seem to care about that.  What is important to them is the radical political agenda that they are relentlessly pursuing.</p>
<p>The following is what <a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/BreakingNews/breaking177.htm">former police detective Iris Aquino</a> had to say about this agreement&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In other words, the Obama administration has been siding with &#8212; and protecting &#8212; lawbreakers, while persecuting and prosecuting American business owners, who in the past administrations were denigrated and even arrested for hiring &#8212; or harboring &#8212; illegal aliens&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But of course this is not the first time the Obama administration has done this sort of thing.  Over the years the Obama administration has made it <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/11-things-that-the-obama-administration-is-doing-to-promote-more-illegal-immigration">abundantly clear</a> that it is on the side of the illegal immigrants.  In fact, the Obama administration <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2009/04/workplace-english-rule-illegal/">has even gone after</a> employers that require their employees to speak English in the workplace even though federal law permits them to do so&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Although federal law allows employers to require English on the job, a national healthcare firm will dish out nearly half a million dollars to settle a discrimination lawsuit in which the U.S. government alleges Hispanic workers were punished for speaking Spanish.</p>
<p>Filed by the federal agency that enforces the nation’s workplace discrimination laws, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the suit accuses Skilled Healthcare Group Inc. of enforcing an English-only rule against Hispanics. The firm operates nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Western and Southern states and the government says Hispanic employees were harassed for not speaking English.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the Obama administration has also tried to do all that it can to get more immigrants enrolled in federal welfare programs.  In fact, the government actually has a website that teaches immigrants <a title="how to sign up for welfare programs" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/government-website-for-immigrants-come-to-america-and-take-advantage-of-our-free-stuff" target="_blank">how to sign up for welfare programs</a> once they arrive in the United States.  On WelcomeToUSA.gov, immigrants are encouraged to sign up for all of the &#8220;government benefits&#8221; that they are eligible for.  Here is an excerpt <a title="from that page" href="http://www.welcometousa.gov/Government_benefits/default.htm" target="_blank">from that page</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p>Depending on your immigration status, length of time in the United States, and income, you may be eligible for some federal benefit programs. Government assistance programs can be critically important to the well-being of some immigrants and their families. Frequently, however, there is a lack of information about how to access such benefits. Benefit programs can be complicated and you may be given misleading information about how they operate.</p></blockquote>
<p>But illegal immigrants are not supposed to be eligible for welfare programs such as food stamps, right?</p>
<p>Technically yes, but the Obama administration <a title="has distributed flyers" href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/26/USDA-to-Illegal-Immigrants-You-Can-Qualify-for-Food-Stamps" target="_blank">has widely distributed materials</a> that inform illegal immigrants that their immigration status <strong>will not be checked</strong> by government officials when they apply for food stamps.</p>
<p>How bizarre is that?</p>
<p>And not only is the Obama administration doing all that it can for illegal immigrants, it is even stopping state governments from enforcing our immigration laws.  In fact, the Obama administration <a title="such as Arizona" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/06/us-obama-immigration-lawsuit-idUSTRE6653Q320100706" target="_blank">actually took the state of Arizona to court</a> to keep them from cracking down on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, illegal immigration continues to have a very negative effect on thousands of communities all over the United States.  If you doubt this, please see my previous article entitled &#8220;<a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/19-very-disturbing-facts-about-illegal-immigration-that-every-american-should-know">19 Very Disturbing Facts About Illegal Immigration That Every American Should Know</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>So what do you think about all of this?</p>
<p>Do you believe that the Obama administration should be helping illegal immigrants in the workplace?</p>

<p>It started earlier this year when Germany <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323468604578245481704511870.html">asked for 300 metric tons of their gold</a> which was supposedly being held at the New York Fed.  If the New York Fed really did have as much physical gold as they claim that they do, that request should have been no problem.  Instead, the Germans were told that it would take <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-01-16/it-will-take-fed-seven-years-deliver-300-tons-german-gold">seven years</a> to fulfill the request.</p>
<p>At that point, alarm bells started to go off in financial circles all over the planet.  People all over the globe began asking for their gold back, and now this is causing serious stress for the bullion banks.  The following is what Hong Kong hedge fund manager William Kaye <a href="http://kingworldnews.com/kingworldnews/KWN_DailyWeb/Entries/2013/8/15_We_Are_Very_Late_In_The_End_Game_-_Its_Close_To_Game_Over.html">told King World News</a> the other day&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>There are serious strains in the (gold) system. I’ve never witnessed such a serious strain in my lifetime in terms of the backwardation of gold, and in terms of the lease rates being negative for such an extended period of time. This suggests that there are two forces at work: One is that there are serious strains in the system &#8212; that the bullion banks are struggling to come up with the physical gold for spot delivery that the market demands.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now the bullion banks are experiencing unprecedented difficulties coming up with the physical gold and physical silver that they are supposed to have.  Evidence of this supply squeeze is starting to pop up all over the place.  Some of this evidence was summarized in a recent article <a href="http://www.silverdoctors.com/jim-willie-everything-points-to-gold/">by Jim Willie</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>It’s so ugly that in the silver market, JPMorgan has not yet satisfied and delivered on the June silver futures contracts!  It’s so ugly that using hidden entities that Andrew Maguire has detected in London, JPM is using hidden entities to hog 90% of the July silver deliveries!</strong></span>   <strong><span style="color: #000000;">It appears that JPM doesn’t have the silver to meet June delivery, and is trying to replenish their own vaults by taking delivery in London, secretly, to replenish their inventory!   Where are they getting it from?  Maybe the SLV!</span></strong></p>
<p>The JPM clients have removed between December and June- close to 40,000 kg of gold- thats 40 metric tons.  While JPM’s house account has removed over 40 tons in the same period!  What’s the lesson there?  It appears JPM’s best friends and clients don’t trust them anymore!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">My best source (originally a trader with Scotia Mocatta) tells me that the allocated gold account raids have resulted in 40-60,000 tons of gold! </span></strong>  (The US likely doesn’t have any of its reported 8,500 tons left at all!).   Rubin and Clinton might have made $2-$3 trillion leasing and selling the US gold.  Someday the US may have to replenish its gold.</p>
<p>We’ve had other things like <a href="http://www.silverdoctors.com/dutch-bank-abn-amro-halts-physical-gold-delivery/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">ABN Amro’s default</span></a>, and <a href="http://www.silverdoctors.com/second-dutch-bank-to-follow-abn-amro-close-gold-accounts/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">another small Dutch bank just made the same statement that they’re not going to redeem on gold accounts</span></a>.   Morgan Stanley is stalling on every single metals transfer request.  When it is finally transferred the serial numbers and weights are different than what was documented.  Clearly the broker dealers are going into the market to find the gold, to find supply just in order to meet their daily requirements.</p>
<p>The Brinks’ accounts are going bare and are almost down to zero – these are all problems on the supply side!</p></blockquote>
<p>At some point the lack of physical gold and the lack of physical silver are going to become glaringly apparent to the general public, and at that point we could see a fundamental shift in the marketplace.  Keith Barron speculated on what the &#8220;trigger&#8221; for this shift might be <a href="http://kingworldnews.com/kingworldnews/KWN_DailyWeb/Entries/2013/8/8_Entities_Prepare_For_COMEX_Failure_That_Will_Shock_The_World.html">during a recent interview with King World News</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>All I know is that this ‘trigger’ which is going to ignite this move is coming, and it will involve substantial repricing of both gold and silver. One possible trigger may turn out to be a failure of the COMEX. We do know that there is a shortage of physical gold for delivery, and that’s because so much gold is going to Asia right now.</p>
<p>You can see by the price action in the U.S. dollar right now that the Asians are dumping their dollars. But, interestingly, they are also paying a premium to get physical gold right now with no delay in shipment. So there is a loss of faith in the paper gold and silver markets by major participants. It’s almost as if they expect a failure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Barron is fully convinced that we will eventually see a &#8220;breaking&#8221; of the COMEX which will shock the world&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>I firmly believe there will be a point in the future when this sort of event triggers a run on the COMEX, and more and more entities are going to ask for physical delivery. This will have the effect of breaking the COMEX and creating a failure. When that takes place you will see an explosion in the prices of gold and silver that will literally shock market participants around the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the truth is that this has been a long time in coming.  The bullion banks should never have made so many empty paper promises.</p>
<p>There is only so much physical gold out there.  Warren Buffett <a title="once estimated" href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/02/09/warren-buffett-berkshire-shareholder-letter/" target="_blank">once estimated</a> that <span style="font-family: inherit;">if all of the gold in the entire world was gathered into one place, it could be formed into a cube that would only be 69 feet long by 69 feet high by 69 feet wide.</span></p>
<p>That isn&#8217;t a whole lot of physical gold.</p>
<p>But there is a massive amount of &#8220;paper gold&#8221; out there today.  In fact, as I noted <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-coming-shortage-of-physical-gold-that-will-change-everything">recently</a>, the Reserve Bank of India says that &#8220;the traded amount of ‘paper linked to gold’ exceeds by far the actual supply of physical gold: the volume on the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) OTC market and the major Futures and Options Exchanges was OVER 92 TIMES that of the underlying Physical Market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Did you grasp that?</p>
<p>The reserve bank of India says that there is more than 92 times as much &#8220;paper gold&#8221; as there is physical gold.</p>
<p>This is why you want to own physical gold.</p>
<p>And right now the global appetite for physical gold is absolutely voracious.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/15/investing/gold-demand-record/index.html?iid=HP_River">CNN</a>, consumer demand for physical gold is now at an all-time record high&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Bargain-hunters are snapping up gold jewelry and coins as investors desert the metal and world prices plunge.</p>
<p>Global consumer demand for gold hit its highest level ever in the second quarter, spiking to 1,083 tons, up 53% compared to the same time last year.</p>
<p>Most of that demand came from China and India, where consumers rushed to buy jewelry, coins and gold bars.</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, according to the latest <a href="http://www.gold.org/media/press_releases/archive/2013/08/gdt_q2_2013_pr/">World Gold Council Gold Demand Trends report</a>, demand for gold bars and gold coins in the second quarter was up <strong>78 percent</strong> over the same quarter last year&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Globally, jewellery demand was up 37% in Q2 2013 to 576 tonnes (t) from 421t in the same quarter last year, reaching its highest level since Q3 2008. In China, demand was up 54% compared to a year ago; while in India demand increased by 51%. There were also significant increases in demand for gold jewellery in other parts of the world: the Middle East region was up by 33%, and in Turkey demand grew by 38%.</p>
<p>Bar and coin investment grew by 78% globally compared to the same quarter last year, topping 500t in a quarter for the first time.  In China, demand for gold bars and coins surged 157% compared with the same quarter last year, while in India it jumped 116% to a record 122t. Taking jewellery demand and bar and coin investment together, global consumer demand totalled 1,083t in the quarter, 53% higher than a year ago.</p>
<p>For the tenth consecutive quarter, central banks were net buyers of gold, purchasing 71t, which reinforces the trend that began in Q1 2011.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of this physical demand is putting a tremendous amount of pressure on the paper market.</p>
<p>At some point the paper market is going to break.</p>
<p>When that happens, the price of gold is going to go absolutely skyrocketing.</p>

<p><strong>#1</strong> The Missouri State Fair has permanently banned a rodeo clown from performing just because he wore an Obama mask, and now all of the other rodeo clowns are being required to take &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/13/rodeo-clowns-asked-take-sensitivity-training/">sensitivity training</a>&#8220;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>But the state commission went further, saying it will require that before the Rodeo Cowboy Association can take part in any future state fair, “they must provide evidence to the director of the Missouri State Fair that they have proof that all officials and subcontractors of the MRCA have successfully participated in sensitivity training.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#2</strong> Government workers in Seattle have been told that they should no longer use the words &#8220;citizen&#8221; and &#8220;brown bag&#8221; because they are <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/02/seattle-officials-call-for-ban-on-potentially-offensive-language/">potentially offensive</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> A Florida police officer recently <a href="http://www.trunews.com/florida-police-officer-fired-after-calling-trayvon-martin-a-thug-on-facebook/">lost his job</a> for calling Trayvon Martin a &#8220;thug&#8221; on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> &#8220;Climate change deniers&#8221; are definitely not wanted at the U.S. Department of the Interior.  Interior Secretary Sally Jewell <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/interior-secretary-i-dont-want-any-climate-change-deniers-in-my-department/article/2534142">was recently quoted</a> as making the following statement: &#8220;I hope there are no climate-change deniers in the Department of Interior&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> A professor at Ball State University was recently banned from even mentioning the concept of intelligent design because it would supposedly &#8220;<a href="http://onenewsnow.com//education/2013/08/12/physics-prof-a-victim-of-%E2%80%98double-standard%E2%80%99-in-academia#.UgrK3T8pgw6">violate the academic integrity</a>&#8221; of the course that he was teaching.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> The mayor of Washington D.C. recently asked singer Donnie McClurkin <a href="http://onenewsnow.com//culture/2013/08/12/gospel-singer-i-was-%E2%80%98asked-not-to-attend%E2%80%99-my-own-concert#.UgqWlz8pgw4">not to attend his own concert</a> because of his views on homosexuality.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer is calling on athletes marching in the opening ceremonies at the Winter Olympics in Sochi next year to &#8220;<a href="http://www.trunews.com/us-lawmaker-calls-for-olympic-gay-rainbow-flag-parade-to-embarrass-putin/">embarrass</a>&#8221; Russian President Vladimir Putin by protesting for gay rights.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> Chaplains in the U.S. military <a title="are being forced" href="http://www.wnd.com/2012/10/military-forces-chaplains-to-perform-gay-marriage/" target="_blank">are being forced</a> to perform gay marriages, even if it goes against their personal religious beliefs.  The few chaplains that have refused to follow orders know that it means the end of their careers.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> The governor of California <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/08/12/calif-governor-signs-transgendered-students-rights-bill/">has signed a bill into law</a> which will allow transgendered students to use whatever bathrooms and gym facilities that they would like&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Transgendered students in California will now have the right to use whichever bathrooms they prefer and join either the boys’ or girls’ sports teams, thanks to landmark legislation signed by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday.</p>
<p>The law <a class="external" href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB1266&amp;search_keywords=" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">amends </a>the state’s education code, and stipulates that each student will have access to facilities, sports teams, and programs that are “consistent with his or her gender identity,” rather than the student’s actual biological composition. A male student who self-identifies as female could therefore use the girls’ bathroom, even if he is anatomically male.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#10</strong> In San Francisco, authorities have installed small plastic &#8220;<a title="privacy screens" href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/07/26/pornography-at-san-francisco-library-reportedly-prompts-privacy-screens/?test=latestnews" target="_blank">privacy screens</a>&#8221; on library computers so that perverts can continue to exercise their &#8220;right&#8221; to watch pornography at the library without children being directly exposed to it.</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> In America today, there are many groups that are absolutely obsessed with <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-name-of-jesus-has-become-a-dirty-word-in-politically-correct-america">eradicating every mention of God</a> out of the public sphere.  For example, an elementary school in North Carolina ordered a little six-year-old girl <a title="to remove the word “God”" href="http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/school-orders-child-to-remove-god-from-poem.html" target="_blank">to remove the word &#8220;God&#8221;</a> from a poem that she wrote to honor her two grandfathers that had served in the Vietnam War.</p>
<p><strong>#12</strong> A high school track team was disqualified earlier this year because one of the runners “<a title="made a gesture thanking God" href="http://www.trunews.com/track-team-disqualified-for-thanking-god/" target="_blank">made a gesture thanking God</a>” once he had crossed the finish line.</p>
<p><strong>#13</strong> Earlier this year, a Florida Atlantic University student that refused to stomp on the name of Jesus <a title="was banned from class" href="http://thestir.cafemom.com/in_the_news/153187/refusing_to_stomp_on_jesuss" target="_blank">was banned from class</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#14</strong> A student at Sonoma State University was ordered to take off a cross that she was wearing because someone &#8220;<a title="could be offended" href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/07/03/student-ordered-to-remove-cross-necklace-at-sonoma-state-university/" target="_blank">could be offended</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p><strong>#15</strong> A teacher in New Jersey <a title="was fired" href="http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2013/06/19/school-calls-cops-on-gideons-distributing-bibles-n1622806" target="_blank">was fired</a> for giving his own Bible to a student that did not own one.</p>
<p><strong>#16</strong> Volunteer chaplains for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department <a title="have been banned" href="http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/police-chaplains-told-to-stop-invoking-jesus.html" target="_blank">have been banned</a> from using the name of Jesus on government property.</p>
<p><strong>#17</strong> According to a new Army manual, U.S. soldiers will now be instructed to avoid &#8220;any criticism of pedophilia&#8221; and to avoid criticizing &#8220;anything related to Islam&#8221;.  The following is from a <a title="Judicial Watch article" href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2012/12/new-army-manual-orders-soldiers-not-to-criticize-taliban/#respond" target="_blank">Judicial Watch article</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p>The draft leaked to the newspaper offers a list of “taboo conversation topics” that soldiers should avoid, including “making derogatory comments about the Taliban,” “advocating women’s rights,” “any criticism of pedophilia,” “directing any criticism towards Afghans,” “mentioning homosexuality and homosexual conduct” or “anything related to Islam.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#18</strong> The Obama administration <a title="has banned" href="http://judicialwatch.org/blog/2012/02/u-s-bans-linking-terrorism-to-muslims-in-agent-training/" target="_blank">has banned</a> all U.S. government agencies from producing any training materials that link Islam with terrorism.  In fact, the FBI has gone back and purged references to Islam and terrorism <a title="from hundreds of old documents" href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/02/hundreds-fbi-documents-muslims/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wired%2Findex+%28Wired%3A+Index+3+%28Top+Stories+2%29%29" target="_blank">from hundreds of old documents</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#19</strong> According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, it is illegal for employers to discriminate against criminals because it has a &#8220;<a title="disproportionate" href="http://blogs.findlaw.com/in_house/2012/01/pepsi-settles-eeoc-racial-bias-case-for-31-million.html" target="_blank">disproportionate</a>&#8221; impact on minorities.</p>
<p>It would be hard to overstate the power that all of this relentless &#8220;thought training&#8221; has on all of us.  And young people are particularly susceptible to the power of suggestion.  If you doubt this, just check out this video of a little boy praying to Barack Obama <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YI4813_v-E">as if he was a deity</a>&#8230;</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-YI4813_v-E" height="338" width="450" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>It would be a huge mistake to underestimate <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/7-things-about-the-mainstream-media-that-they-do-not-want-you-to-know">the power of the mainstream media</a> in America today.  As I mentioned <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/newly-discovered-eighth-grade-exam-from-1912-shows-how-dumbed-down-america-has-become">the other day</a>, Americans watch an average of about 153 hours of television a month.  When Americans go to work or go to school, the conversations that they have with others are mostly based on content that the media feeds them.  And about 90 percent of what we watch on television is controlled by just six gigantic corporations.</p>
<p>But the media is not the only source that is telling us what to think.  The truth is that the messaging that comes from all of our major institutions (the government, the media, the education system, etc.) is remarkably consistent.  The establishment wants to control what we say and how we think, and they have a relentless propaganda machine that never stops working.</p>
<p>The way that we all see the world has been greatly shaped by the thousands of hours of  &#8220;thought training&#8221; that we have all received over the years.  Understanding what is being done to us is the first step toward breaking free.</p>

<p>Just check out some of the questions from the eighth grade exam that was discovered.  Do you think that you could correctly answer these?&#8230;</p>
<p>-Through which waters would a vessel pass in going from England through the Suez Canal to Manila?</p>
<p>-How does the liver compare in size with other glands in the human body?</p>
<p>-How long of a rope is required to reach from the top of a building 40 feet high to the ground 30 feet from the base of a building?</p>
<p>-Compare arteries and veins as to function. Where is the blood carried to be purified?</p>
<p>-During which wars were the following battles fought: Brandywine, Great Meadows, Lundy&#8217;s Lane, Antietam, Buena Vista?</p>
<p>A copy of the exam is posted below.  Today, it would be a real challenge for many college students to correctly answer most of these questions correctly&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/newly-discovered-eighth-grade-exam-from-1912-shows-how-dumbed-down-america-has-become/eighth-grade-exam" rel="attachment wp-att-3661"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3661" alt="Eighth Grade Exam" src="http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eighth-Grade-Exam.jpg" width="432" height="2090" /></a></p>
<p>If you would like to know what the correct answers to these questions are, you can find them <a href="http://www.bullittcountyhistory.com/bchistory/schoolexam1912ans.html">right here</a>.</p>
<p>One of the areas that Americans are horribly deficient in today is geography.  If you give them a blank world map, most Americans can only identify a very limited number of countries.  In fact, according to a survey that was conducted by the National Geographic Society several years ago, only <a title="37 percent" href="http://www.gse.harvard.edu/news_events/ed/2007/winter/features/geography.html" target="_blank">37 percent</a> of all Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 could find the nation of Iraq on a map of the world even though the United States was actively fighting a war there at the time.</p>
<p>Our young people are also horribly deficient when it comes to math and science.  At this point, 15-year-olds in the United States <a title="do not even rank in the top half" href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/flowchart/2009/10/26/9-signs-of-america-in-decline.html" target="_blank">do not even rank in the top half</a> of all industrialized nations when it comes to math and science literacy.</p>
<p>How do we expect to thrive as a nation with these kinds of results?</p>
<p>In a previous article entitled &#8220;<a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/dumb-as-a-rock-you-will-be-absolutely-amazed-at-the-things-that-u-s-high-school-students-do-not-know">Dumb As A Rock: You Will Be Absolutely Amazed At The Things That U.S. High School Students Do Not Know</a>&#8220;, I discussed some more survey results that show how dumb our high school students have become&#8230;</p>
<p>*Only 43 percent of all U.S. high school students knew that the Civil War was fought some time between 1850 and 1900.</p>
<p>*More than a quarter of all U.S. high school students thought that Christopher Columbus made his famous voyage across the Atlantic Ocean after the year 1750.</p>
<p>*Approximately a third of all U.S. high school students did not know that the Bill of Rights guarantees freedom of speech and freedom of religion.</p>
<p>*Only 60 percent of all U.S. students knew that World War I was fought some time between 1900 and 1950.</p>
<p>Even more shocking were the results of <a title="a survey of Oklahoma high school students" href="http://www.news9.com/global/story.asp?s=11141949" target="_blank">a survey of Oklahoma high school students</a> conducted back in 2009.  The following is a list of the questions that were asked and the percentage of students that answered correctly….</p>
<p>What is the supreme law of the land? <strong>28 percent</strong></p>
<p>What do we call the first ten amendments to the Constitution? <strong>26 percent</strong></p>
<p>What are the two parts of the U.S. Congress? <strong>27 percent</strong></p>
<p>How many justices are there on the Supreme Court? <strong>10 percent</strong></p>
<p>Who wrote the Declaration of Independence? <strong>14 percent</strong></p>
<p>What ocean is on the east coast of the United States? <strong>61 percent</strong></p>
<p>What are the two major political parties in the United States? <strong>43 percent</strong></p>
<p>We elect a U.S. senator for how many years? <strong>11 percent</strong></p>
<p>Who was the first President of the United States? <strong>23 percent</strong></p>
<p>Who is in charge of the executive branch? <strong>29 percent</strong></p>
<p>So why is this happening?</p>
<p>Well, for one thing, our system of public education is a complete and total joke.  We have millions of kids &#8220;graduating from high school&#8221; that can barely read, that have almost no ability to speak in public, that cannot write a decent essay and that cannot balance a checkbook.</p>
<p>It also doesn&#8217;t help that Americans (especially young Americans) are absolutely addicted to entertainment.  Americans spend an average of <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2009/americans-watching-more-tv-than-ever.html">153 hours</a> watching television each month, and when we aren&#8217;t watching television we are watching movies, playing video games, surfing the Internet, etc.</p>
<p>When is the last time that you saw a young person actually reading a book that was not required for school?  Yes, it does happen once in a while, but it is so rare that it is kind of startling when you spot it happening.</p>
<p>But it is not just our young people that have been &#8220;dumbed down&#8221;.  Even our presidents have been &#8220;dumbed down&#8221;.  If you doubt this, just check out <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/feb/12/state-of-the-union-reading-level">this amazing graphic</a> which shows how the reading level of State of the Union addresses has steadily declined since the beginning of our nation.</p>
<p>Personally, I have an awareness that I should be able to think much more clearly than I am able to right now.  I can feel the effect that our society has had on my own mental abilities, and it frustrates me.</p>
<p>A lot has been written about the decline of our health here in America, but very little gets written about our mental decline.  That is a shame, because our ability to think clearly and rationally is so very critical to our future.</p>
<p>So what do you think about all of this?</p>
<p>Do you agree that America has been &#8220;dumbed down&#8221;?</p>

<p><strong>#1</strong> Over the past 20 years, gun sales have absolutely exploded, but homicides with firearms are down <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-08-09/picturing-plunge-gun-crimes-gun-sales-surge">39 percent</a> during that time and &#8220;other crimes with firearms&#8221; are down <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-08-09/picturing-plunge-gun-crimes-gun-sales-surge">69 percent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> A study published <a href="http://theacru.org/acru/harvard_study_gun_control_is_counterproductive/">in the Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy</a> discovered that nations that have more guns tend to have less crime.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> The nine European nations with the lowest rate of gun ownership rate have a combined murder rate <a href="http://theacru.org/acru/harvard_study_gun_control_is_counterproductive/">that is three times greater</a> than the nine European nation with the highest rate of gun ownership.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> Almost every mass shooting that has occurred in the United States since 1950 has taken place in a state <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2012/12/25/gun-free-zone-john-lott/1791085/">with strict gun control laws</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=272929">With just one exception</a>, every public mass shooting in the USA since at least 1950 has taken place where citizens are banned from carrying guns. Despite strict gun regulations, Europe has had three of the worst six school shootings.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#5</strong> The United States is #1 in the world in gun ownership, and yet it is <a title="only 28th" href="http://www.infowars.com/ben-swann-destroys-piers-morgans-anti-gun-argument/" target="_blank">only 28th</a> in the world in gun murders per 100,000 people.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> The violent crime rate in the United States actually fell from <a title="757.7" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=FWNOiw_XIV8" target="_blank">757.7</a> per 100,000 in 1992 to <a title="386.3" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=FWNOiw_XIV8" target="_blank">386.3</a> per 100,000 in 2011.  During that same time period, the murder rate fell from <a title="9.3" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=FWNOiw_XIV8" target="_blank">9.3</a> per 100,000 to <a title="4.7" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=FWNOiw_XIV8" target="_blank">4.7</a> per 100,000.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> Approximately <a title="200,000 women" href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/you-wont-believe-the-crazy-things-that-are-being-said-about-gun-owners">200,000 women</a> in the United States use guns to protect themselves against sexual crime every single year.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> Overall, guns in the United States are used <a title="80 times more often" href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/you-wont-believe-the-crazy-things-that-are-being-said-about-gun-owners">80 times more often</a> to prevent crime than they are to take lives.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> The number of unintentional fatalities due to firearms declined <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-08-09/picturing-plunge-gun-crimes-gun-sales-surge">by 58 percent</a> between 1991 and 2011.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> Despite the very strict ban on guns in the UK, the overall rate of violent crime in the UK is <strong>about 4 times higher</strong> than it is in the United States.  In one recent year, there were <a title="2,034 violent crimes" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1196941/The-violent-country-Europe-Britain-worse-South-Africa-U-S.html#ixzz2HQDkC3re" target="_blank">2,034 violent crimes</a> per 100,000 people in the UK.  In the United States, there were only <a title="466 violent crimes" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1196941/The-violent-country-Europe-Britain-worse-South-Africa-U-S.html#ixzz2HQDkC3re" target="_blank">466 violent crimes</a> per 100,000 people during that same year.  Do we really want to be more like the UK?</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> The UK has approximately <a title="125 percent" href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_rap_vic-crime-rape-victims" target="_blank">125 percent</a> more rape victims per 100,000 people each year than the United States does.</p>
<p><strong>#12</strong> The UK has approximately <a title="133 percent" href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_ass_vic-crime-assault-victims" target="_blank">133 percent</a> more assault victims per 100,000 people each year than the United States does.</p>
<p><strong>#13</strong> The UK has the <a title="fourth highest burglary rate" href="http://www.infowars.com/ben-swann-destroys-piers-morgans-anti-gun-argument/" target="_blank">fourth highest burglary rate</a> in the EU.</p>
<p><strong>#14</strong> The UK has the <a title="second highest overall crime rate" href="http://www.infowars.com/ben-swann-destroys-piers-morgans-anti-gun-argument/" target="_blank">second highest overall crime rate</a> in the EU.</p>
<p><strong>#15</strong> Down in Australia, gun murders increased by about <a title="19 percent" href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/cold-hard-facts-on-gun-bans-the-cost-of-liberty-can-be-measured-in-the-loss-of-life_08032012" target="_blank">19 percent</a> and armed robberies increased by about <a title="69 percent" href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/cold-hard-facts-on-gun-bans-the-cost-of-liberty-can-be-measured-in-the-loss-of-life_08032012" target="_blank">69 percent</a> <strong>after</strong> a gun ban was instituted.</p>
<p><strong>#16</strong> The city of Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the United States.  So has this reduced crime?  Of course not.  As I wrote about <a title="the other day" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/large-cities-all-over-america-are-degenerating-into-gang-infested-war-zones" target="_blank">recently</a>, the murder rate in Chicago was <a title="about 17 percent higher" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-chicago-500th-homicide-20121229,0,3765416.story" target="_blank">about 17 percent higher</a> in 2012 than it was in 2011, and Chicago is now considered to be &#8220;<a title="the deadliest global city" href="http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/The-Deadliest-Global-City-163874546.html" target="_blank">the deadliest global city</a>&#8220;.  If you can believe it, there were about as many murders in Chicago during 2012 as there was in <strong>the entire nation of Japan</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>#17</strong> After the city of Kennesaw, Georgia passed a law <strong>requiring every home to have a gun</strong>, the crime rate dropped <a title="by more than 50 percent" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/society-is-crumbling-right-in-front-of-our-eyes-and-banning-guns-wont-help" target="_blank">by more than 50 percent</a> over the course of the next 23 years and there was an <a href="http://www.cityrating.com/crime-statistics/georgia/kennesaw.html#.UggeoD8pgw6">89% decline in burglaries</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#18</strong> According to <a title="Gun Owners of America" href="http://gunowners.org/news12202012.htm" target="_blank">Gun Owners of America</a>, the governments of the world slaughtered more than 170 million of their own people during the 20th century.  The vast majority of those people had been disarmed by their own governments prior to being slaughtered.</p>
<p>Sadly, you rarely hear any facts like these on the mainstream news networks.  Instead, they give countless amounts of air time to the radicals that are obsessed with gun control.</p>
<p>And did you know that there is now an official propaganda manual that has been put out for gun control advocates?  This manual actually encourages gun control advocates <a href="http://mobile.wnd.com/2013/08/democrat-manual-how-to-lie-about-gun-control/">to emotionally exploit major shooting incidents</a> to advance the cause of gun control&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Democratic strategists have drafted a how-to manual on manipulating the public’s emotions toward gun control in the aftermath of a major shooting.</p>
<p>“A high-profile gun-violence incident temporarily draws more people into the conversation about gun violence,” asserts the guide. “We should rely on emotionally powerful language, feelings and images to bring home the terrible impact of gun violence.”</p>
<p>The 80-page document titled <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/748675/gun-violencemessaging-guide-pdf-1.pdf">“Preventing Gun Violence Through Effective Messaging,”</a> also urges gun-control advocates use images of frightening-looking guns and shooting scenes to make their point.</p>
<p>“The most powerful time to communicate is when concern and emotions are running at their peak,” the guide insists. “The debate over gun violence in America is periodically punctuated by high-profile gun violence incidents including Columbine, Virginia Tech, Tucson, the Trayvon Martin killing, Aurora and Oak Creek. When an incident such as these attracts sustained media attention, it creates a unique climate for our communications efforts.”</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read the rest of that manual <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/748675/gun-violencemessaging-guide-pdf-1.pdf">right here</a>.</p>
<p>So will those pushing gun control win, or will the American people be able to see through the propaganda and insist on keeping their constitutional right to bear arms?</p>

<p>Right now, we desperately need the American people to contact their representatives in Congress and demand that they vote against this bill.  Sadly, this is not likely to happen because most Americans have absolutely no idea how negatively illegal immigration is affecting this nation.</p>
<p>The following are 19 very disturbing facts about illegal immigration that every American should know&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> <a href="http://cis.org/immigrant-welfare-use-2011">57 percent</a> of all households that are led by an immigrant (legal or illegal) are enrolled in at least one welfare program.</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> According to one study, the cost to U.S. taxpayers of legalizing current illegal immigrants would be approximately <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/may/6/report-legalizing-illegal-immigrants-cost-6-3-t/">6.3 trillion dollars</a> over the next 50 years.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> The Obama administration <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/26/USDA-to-Illegal-Immigrants-You-Can-Qualify-for-Food-Stamps">has distributed flyers</a> that tell illegal immigrants that their immigration status <strong>will not be checked</strong> when they apply for food stamps.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> The Department of Homeland Security says that it has lost track of <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/30/homeland-security-loses-track-of-1-million-foreign/">a million people</a> that have entered this country but that appear never to have left.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> <a href="http://www.trunews.com/1-in-3-adults-in-parts-of-l-a-are-in-u-s-illegally-study-finds/">One out of every five children</a> living in Los Angeles County has a parent that is in the country illegally.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> In one recent year, taxpayers in Los Angeles County <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/government-website-for-immigrants-come-to-america-and-take-advantage-of-our-free-stuff">spent 600 million dollars</a> on welfare for children of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> Thanks to illegal immigration, California&#8217;s overstretched health care system <a title="is on the verge of collapse" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-erdoctors28-2009jan28,0,7632115.story" target="_blank">is on the verge of collapse</a>.  Dozens of California hospitals and emergency rooms have shut down over the past decade because they could not afford to stay open after being endlessly swamped by illegal immigrants who were simply not able to pay for the services that they were receiving.  As a result, the remainder of the health care system in the state of California is now beyond overloaded.  This had led to brutally long waits, diverted ambulances and even unnecessary patient deaths.  At this point, the state of California now ranks <a title="dead last" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-california-is-the-next-greece-2010-05#california-has-americas-fewest-7-emergency-rooms-per-one-million-people-6" target="_blank">dead last</a> out of all 50 states in the number of emergency rooms per million people.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> It has been estimated that U.S. taxpayers spend <a title="$12,000,000,000 a year" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY6t2ckpb5g" target="_blank">$12,000,000,000 a year</a> on primary and secondary school education for the children of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> It is estimated that illegal aliens make up <a title="approximately 30 percent" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY6t2ckpb5g" target="_blank">approximately 30 percent</a> of the population in federal, state and local prisons and that the total cost of incarcerating them <a title="is more than $1.6 billion annually" href="http://www.cis.org/" target="_blank">is more than $1.6 billion annually</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> The federal government actually has a website that teaches immigrants <a title="how to sign up for welfare programs" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/government-website-for-immigrants-come-to-america-and-take-advantage-of-our-free-stuff" target="_blank">how to sign up for welfare programs</a> once they arrive in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> The Obama administration recently introduced the very first <a title="“unmanned” border station" href="http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/us-mexico-border-unmanned-border-crossing/story?id=18115620" target="_blank">&#8220;unmanned&#8221; border station</a> along the Texas-Mexico border.</p>
<p><strong>#12</strong> The Obama administration has sued individual states <a title="such as Arizona" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/06/us-obama-immigration-lawsuit-idUSTRE6653Q320100706" target="_blank">such as Arizona</a> that have tried to crack down on illegal immigration.</p>
<p><strong>#13</strong> According to the FBI, there are approximately <a title="1.4 million" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/1-4-million-gang-members-and-more-pour-into-the-united-states-every-single-day" target="_blank">1.4 million</a> gang members living in our cities.  Illegal immigration has been one of the primary factors that has fueled the growth of these gangs.</p>
<p><strong>#14</strong> As I have written about <a title="the other day" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/12-factors-that-are-turning-the-streets-of-america-into-a-living-hell" target="_blank">previously</a>, there are only about 200 police officers assigned to Chicago&#8217;s Gang Enforcement Unit to handle the estimated <a title="100,000 gang members" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57470618/chicago-police-sergeant-tribal-warfare-on-the-streets" target="_blank">100,000 gang members</a> living in the city.</p>
<p><strong>#15</strong> Mexican drug cartels make approximately <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/government-website-for-immigrants-come-to-america-and-take-advantage-of-our-free-stuff">6.6 billion dollars a year</a> &#8220;exporting&#8221; illegal drugs to the United States.</p>
<p><strong>#16</strong> It is an open secret that Mexican drug cartels are <a title="openly conducting military operations" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/invasion-mexican-drug-cartels-are-openly-conducting-military-operations-inside-the-united-states" target="_blank">openly conducting military operations</a> inside the United States.  The handful of border patrol agents that we have guarding the border are massively outgunned and outmanned.</p>
<p><strong>#17</strong> According to the Justice Department’s National Drug Intelligence Center, Mexican drug cartels were actively operating <a title="in 50 different U.S. cities" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/09/us/mexican-cartels-small-town-usa/index.html" target="_blank">in 50 different U.S. cities</a> in 2006.  By 2010, that number had skyrocketed <a title="to 1,286" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/09/us/mexican-cartels-small-town-usa/index.html" target="_blank">to 1,286</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#18</strong> Overall, <a title="more than 55,000 people" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2157172/Bodies-14-dismembered-men-women-dumped-outside-Mexican-city-hall-bordering-Texas.html#ixzz1xPYcIuUg" target="_blank">more than 55,000 people</a> have been killed in drug-related violence in Mexico since 2006.  That same level of violence will eventually show up in major U.S. cities unless something dramatic is done about illegal immigration.</p>
<p><strong>#19</strong> It is being projected that the Senate immigration bill will bring <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/04/26/anti-immigration-group-immigration-bill-to-bring-in-at-least-33-million-people/">33 million more people</a> to the United States over the next decade.</p>
<p>One of the very few things that the federal government is actually required to do by the U.S. Constitution is to defend our borders, and unfortunately the Obama administration has willingly chosen to leave our borders completely wide open.  In fact, you can go down to the Texas border right now <a href="http://www.infowars.com/texas-border-wide-open-an-alex-jones-special-report/">and watch illegal immigrants hop right across the Rio Grande</a>.</p>
<p>Several retired Border Patrol agents recently drafted an open letter to the American people on the subject of illegal immigration, and what they had to say was quite startling.  The following is an excerpt from that letter that was in a recent <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/07/Ex-Border-Patrol-agents-American-politicians-helping-cartels-invest-millions-to-build-criminal-network-inside-U-S-Ex-Border-Patrol-agents-American-politicians-helping-cartels-invest-millions-to-build-criminal-network-inside-U-S">Breitbart article</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Transnational criminal enterprises have annually invested millions of dollars to create and staff international drug and human smuggling networks inside the United States; thus it is no surprise that they continue to accelerate their efforts to get trusted representatives in place as a means to guarantee continued success,” the Border Patrol agents wrote.</p>
<p>“We must never lose sight of the fact that the United States is the market place for the bulk of transnational criminal businesses engaged in human trafficking and the smuggling, distribution and sale of illegal drugs. Organized crime on this scale we are speaking about cannot exist without political protection.”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to those retired border agents, by refusing to secure our border the Obama administration is openly facilitating the trafficking of drugs into the United States&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Most heroin, cocaine, meth, and marijuana marketed in the United States is produced outside of our country, and then smuggled into the United States,” they wrote. “The placement of trusted foreign employees inside the United States is imperative to insure success in continuing to supply the demand, and returning the profits to the foreign organization. Members of these vicious transnational crime syndicates are already well established in more than 2,000 American cities and their numbers are increasing as networks expand and demands accelerate. These transnational criminals present a real and present danger to all Americans, and they live among us.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, in politically correct America you can&#8217;t even talk about the problem of illegal immigration these days without being labeled as a &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>For the record, I believe that all people deserve love and respect no matter what they look like or where they are born.  God created us all and He loves us all very much.  I have long been <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/love-your-neighbor-as-you-love-yourself-an-appeal-for-reconciliation">a very strong advocate</a> for racial reconciliation in this country, and I will continue to be.</p>
<p>And there are tens of millions of Latino-Americans in this country that are hard working, law-abiding citizens.  They have done things the right way, and it is extremely unfortunate that they often get lumped in with millions of illegal immigrants that willingly choose to break our laws.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have a system of immigration today that greatly rewards lawless behavior.  We have made coming into this country through the front door exceedingly difficult, but we have left the back door completely wide open.</p>
<p>So hard working, law-abiding people that want to do things the right way are kept out, but those that want to come here and commit crimes or abuse the system are free to come on over any time that they would like.</p>
<p>What sense does that make?</p>
<p>Our immigration system is completely broken, but these days we cannot even have a rational debate about these issues.  In politically correct America, illegal immigrants have become a &#8220;favored class&#8221; of people that you are never supposed to say anything bad about.</p>
<p>In fact, one activist recently went out and actually got people to sign a petition that said that we should let illegal immigrants out of prison <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wjEh0QfM-WE">no matter what crimes they have committed</a>&#8230;</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/wjEh0QfM-WE" height="253" width="450" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>What in the world is happening to this country?</p>

<p>Increasingly, police departments all over the United States are being transformed into military-style units.  These days, even very minor violations of the law can result in a SWAT team raid.  The following is from a recent article <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/are_police_in_america_now_a_military_occupying_force">by John Whitehead of the Rutherford Institute</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Consider that in 1980, there were roughly 3,000 SWAT team-style raids in the US. By 2001, that number had grown to 45,000 and has since swelled to more than 80,000 SWAT team raids per year. On an average day in America, over 100 Americans have their homes raided by SWAT teams. In fact, there are few communities without a SWAT team on their police force today. In 1984, 25.6 percent of towns with populations between 25,000 and 50,000 people had a SWAT team. That number rose to 80 percent by 2005.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it is not just local police departments that are being militarized.  This is happening on the federal level as well.  In fact, according to Whitehead even the Department of Education and NASA now have their own SWAT teams&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>When it comes to SWAT-style tactics being used in routine policing, the federal government is one of the largest offenders, with multiple agencies touting their own SWAT teams, including the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Consumer Product Safety Commission, NASA, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the US National Park Service, and the FDA.</p></blockquote>
<p>What in the world does NASA need a SWAT team for?</p>
<p>The police culture in America has fundamentally changed.  In the old days, most police officers were extremely helpful and would give you directions or help you get your cat out of a tree.</p>
<p>But if you stop and ask a police officer for help today, you will be lucky if all you get is some dirty language.  These days, police all over the nation are actually being trained to bark orders at you and to respond to the least bit of resistance with overwhelming force.</p>
<p>The results of this kind of training can often be extremely tragic.  Just the other day, a <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/why-did-cops-kill-this-95-year-old-in-walker/#PrQIqogStIhAtSZO.99">95-year-old World War II veteran</a> living in a retirement home near Chicago was murdered by police just because he did not want to undergo high-risk surgery&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A 95-year-old man who served his country during World War II is now dead after police stormed his retirement home with riot shields, Tasered him and shot him with bean bag rounds – all because he adamantly refused to undergo high-risk surgery.</p>
<p>U.S. Army Air Corps veteran John Wrana, who was honorably discharged as a sergeant after he served in the India-Burma campaign, used a walker because family members said he was “wobbly” on his feet, according to the Chicago Tribune. The elderly veteran was shot down by enemy fire during the war.</p>
<p>On July 26, a doctor reportedly told Wrana if he survived surgery, he would likely be put on life support. The elderly man refused the operation, and paramedics attempted to involuntarily transport him for medical treatment. He was sitting in a chair, holding a cane and a shoe horn when police arrived at the Victory Centre senior living facility located just south of Chicago.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why did the police have to act like that?</p>
<p>Is there any police officer out there that cannot physically handle a 95-year-old man?</p>
<p>That 95-year-old veteran survived fighting the Japanese, but he was not able to survive the thuggish behavior of our own police.</p>
<p>And most Americans don&#8217;t realize this, but when police pull you over they can take cash and property from you even if you have not done anything wrong.  It is called &#8220;civil forfeiture&#8221; and it is one of the worst things about U.S. law.  Civil forfeiture was described in a recent article <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/08/08/the-tactic-police-can-use-to-take-cash-and-property-from-those-who-havent-been-convicted-of-a-crime/">by Becket Adams</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Did you know that the police can confiscate items such as cash and property from people who have never been convicted of a crime?</p>
<p>It’s true, and it’s all because of a little-known police tactic called civil forfeiture.</p>
<p>A product of the so-called “war on drugs,” civil forfeiture was part of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/jmd/afp/02fundreport/02_2.html">Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984</a> passed by Congress 29 years ago. The bill gives law enforcement officials a portion of the assets seized during drug raids and similar  investigations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The following are some examples of the abuse of civil forfeiture that were detailed <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/08/12/130812fa_fact_stillman?currentPage=all">in a recent article in the New Yorker</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>-Police took the home of an elderly couple in Philadelphia because their son allegedly sold $20 worth of marijuana on their front porch.</p>
<p>-Police in Virginia pulled over a speeder and took $28,500 that was intended to be used to purchase a new parcel of land for a Pentecostal church.</p>
<p>-One town in Texas has actually been caught threatening to take children away from innocent couples if they don&#8217;t sign over the cash that they are carrying to the police&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The county’s district attorney, a fifty-seven-year-old woman with feathered Charlie’s Angels hair named Lynda K. Russell, arrived an hour later. Russell, who moonlighted locally as a country singer, told Henderson and Boatright that they had two options. They could face felony charges for “money laundering” and “child endangerment,” in which case they would go to jail and their children would be handed over to foster care. Or they could sign over their cash to the city of Tenaha, and get back on the road. “No criminal charges shall be filed,” a waiver she drafted read, “and our children shall not be turned over to CPS,” or Child Protective Services.</p>
<p>“Where are we?” Boatright remembers thinking. “Is this some kind of foreign country, where they’re selling people’s kids off?” Holding her sixteen-month-old on her hip, she broke down in tears.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have not read the new article in the New Yorker that goes into great detail about all of this, you can find it <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/08/12/130812fa_fact_stillman?currentPage=all">right here</a>.</p>
<p>So why are police all over America acting like this?</p>
<p>Well, one of the primary factors is that they are just following the example that is being set on the federal level.</p>
<p>The entire country is rapidly being transformed <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/category/big-brother">into a &#8220;Big Brother&#8221; police state</a>, and most Americans seem to like it that way.</p>
<p>And with each passing year, it just gets even worse.  For example, we were originally told that the TSA would only be hassling us at our airports, but now they are <strong>everywhere</strong>.  As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/us/tsa-expands-duties-beyond-airport-security.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the New York Times</a> recently reported, TSA &#8220;VIPR teams&#8221; are now being deployed almost everywhere there are large gatherings of people&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>With little fanfare, the agency best known for airport screenings has vastly expanded its reach to sporting events, music festivals, rodeos, highway weigh stations and train terminals.</p></blockquote>
<p>This &#8220;VIPR team&#8221; program is &#8220;growing rapidly&#8221;, and apparently these &#8220;VIPR teams&#8221; conducted 8,800 &#8220;unannounced checkpoints&#8221; last year&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The program now has a $100 million annual budget and is growing rapidly, increasing to several hundred people and 37 teams last year, up from 10 teams in 2008. T.S.A. records show that the teams ran more than 8,800 unannounced checkpoints and search operations with local law enforcement outside of airports last year, including those at the Indianapolis 500 and the Democratic and Republican national political conventions.</p></blockquote>
<p>So where is the outrage?</p>
<p>A small minority of the American people have been sounding the alarm <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/21-facts-about-nsa-snooping-that-every-american-should-know">about NSA snooping</a> and other abuses, but most Americans don&#8217;t really seem to care about these things very much.</p>
<p>In fact, according to a new survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, <a href="http://www.trunews.com/half-of-americans-dont-want-the-media-to-report-on-surveillance/">47 percent</a> of all Americans don&#8217;t even want the media to report on secret government surveillance programs.</p>
<p>So not only do they not want the surveillance to stop, 47 percent of all Americans do not even want to hear anything about it on the news.</p>
<p>How sickening is that?</p>
<p>Sadly, this is not the first survey that has produced this kind of a result.  For much more on this, please see my previous article entitled &#8220;<a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/19-surveys-which-prove-that-a-large-chunk-of-the-population-is-made-up-of-totally-clueless-sheeple">19 Surveys Which Prove That A Large Chunk Of The Population Is Made Up Of Totally Clueless Sheeple</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>In the end, we will get the government that we deserve.  And according to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/world/middleeast/qaeda-messages-prompt-us-terror-warning.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;">the New York Times</a>, at this point our government is even willing to manufacture fake terror threats in order to distract us from their surveillance activities&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Some analysts and Congressional officials suggested Friday that emphasizing a terrorist threat now was a good way to divert attention from the uproar over the N.S.A.&#8217;s data-collection programs, and that if it showed the intercepts had uncovered a possible plot, even better.</p></blockquote>
<p>What in the world is happening to America?</p>
<p>Is there any hope for us?</p>

<p>This philosophy is taken even further in a new Time Magazine article.  The article is entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2148636,00.html">The Childfree Life: When having it all means not having children</a>&#8220;, and it openly promotes a &#8220;childless lifestyle&#8221; as the path to the good life for young U.S. couples.  The following is how the article begins&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>One evening when she was 14 years old, Laura Scott was washing dishes in the kitchen with her mother when she decided she didn&#8217;t want to have a child. At 26, Scott got married and waited for her mind to change. &#8220;It never happened,&#8221; she says. &#8220;And I realized I was going to be fine.&#8221; Now 50, Scott is more than fine: she&#8217;s fulfilled. And she&#8217;s not alone. The birthrate in the U.S. is the lowest in recorded American history. From 2007 to 2011, the most recent year for which there&#8217;s data, the fertility rate declined 9%. A 2010 Pew Research report showed that childlessness has risen across all racial and ethnic groups, adding up to about 1 in 5 American women who end their childbearing years maternity-free, compared with 1 in 10 in the 1970s.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article goes on to point out that the average cost of raising a child born in 2011 to adulthood will be approximately <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/time-magazine-glamorizes-life-without-children/">$234,900</a>, and it suggests that women should think long and hard before making such a commitment.</p>
<p>Well, what is a woman to do if she gets pregnant and she decides that raising that child will ruin her life?</p>
<p>According to the entertainment industry and the mainstream media, <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/tag/abortion">abortion</a> is a very simple answer to that problem.</p>
<p>In America today, the vast majority of abortions are done <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/19-facts-about-abortion-in-america-that-should-make-you-very-sick">for the sake of convenience</a>.  Abortion is essentially a human sacrifice to our own selfishness, and there are millions upon millions of Americans that will go to any lengths to justify the murder of their own children.</p>
<p>In fact, it has gotten so bad that now many liberal thinkers are even postulating that life may not even begin at birth unless parents decide that it does.</p>
<p>Yes, that sounds absolutely insane, but that is apparently what <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/07/25/MSNBC-s-Melissa-Harris-Perry-Says-Life-Begins-When-Parents-Decide-It-Does">MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry</a> believes&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>MSNBC&#8217;s Melissa Harris-Perry thinks she has the answer to the ages old question of just when life begins. Her answer: life begins whenever parents &#8220;decide&#8221; it does.</p>
<p>Practically since the beginning of the national abortion debate the most fought over question between the pro-abortion and pro-life sides is just when does life begin? In an attempt to avoid the arbitrary, most try to utilize some sort of scientific reasoning to decide when life is life. The pro-life side says life begins as soon as the egg is fertilized while the pro-abortion side often contends that life isn&#8217;t life until it is self-sustaining, meaning a fetus isn&#8217;t &#8220;life&#8221; until it can survive outside the womb.</p>
<p>But here comes extreme left-winger Harris-Perry to offer the most arbitrary criteria of all: whenever anyone feels like life begins, then that is &#8220;life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When does life begin? I submit the answer depends an awful lot on the feeling of the parents. A powerful feeling&#8211;but not science,&#8221; Harris-Perry said on her July 21 MSNBC show.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result of our national obsession with selfishness, our population growth has now fallen below replacement rate.  The following is from a recent article <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/time-magazine-glamorizes-life-without-children/">by Aaron Dykes and Melissa Melton</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Meanwhile most Western nations are now facing a “baby bust,” with population growth falling well below the replacement rate. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population" target="_blank"><strong>global fertility rate has fallen to 2.42 births</strong></a> in 2011 numbers (with 2.1 needed for statistical replacement, or, an equilibrium of human births). The United States, like other Western nations, has already fallen below replacement rate, <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2054rank.html?countryname=United%20States&amp;countrycode=us&amp;regionCode=noa&amp;rank=146#us" target="_blank">with a population growth rate of 0.9% and falling</a>, insufficient for continuity, which in turn affects the possibilities for economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today we look around and wonder where we will get <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-tip-of-the-iceberg-of-the-coming-retirement-crisis-that-will-shake-america-to-the-core">the trillions of dollars</a> of retirement benefits that we have promised to the Baby Boomers.</p>
<p>Well, if we had not aborted more than 50 million babies since Roe v. Wade was decided, perhaps we would have enough workers to pay the bills.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier in this article, our obsession with selfishness has also resulted in the U.S. marriage rate dropping <a href="http://www.religiontoday.com/blog/u-s-marriage-rate-drops-to-new-low.html">to an all-time record low</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The marriage rate has fluctuated in the past, with dips in the 1930s and 1960s, but it has been in steady decline since the 1970s. Now, researchers report that the marriage rate has dropped to a new low of 31.1, meaning there are about 31 marriages in the U.S. for every 1,000 unmarried women, researchers found. In 1950, that number was 90.2. In 1920, it was 92.3.</p></blockquote>
<p>In America today, young men and young women are both taught that they need to put off marriage until their educations are done and their careers have started.</p>
<p>So instead of entering into committed relationships at a young age like previous generations did, our young people are being encouraged to embrace &#8220;the hookup culture&#8221;.  The following is an excerpt from a recent article by Mona Charen entitled &#8220;<a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/monacharen/2013/07/23/the-new-brainwashing-women-like-hookups-n1646492?utm_source=thdaily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=nl">The New Brainwashing: Women Like Hookups</a>&#8220;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Fifty years on, we have this dispatch from the University of Pennsylvania: &#8220;Sex on Campus: She Can Play That Game Too,&#8221; a <i>New York Times</i> account of the way women at one Ivy League school are supposedly &#8220;hooking up&#8221; in preference to having relationships. It&#8217;s not that the sexual revolution actually favored men, the <i>Times</i> reassures its readers, it&#8217;s just that women are too focused on careers to make time for men. They pursue sex with &#8220;hookup buddies&#8221; without a flicker of regret.</p>
<p>This is the new brainwashing. Women have been sold (and sold and sold) on the notion that happiness and fulfillment are to be found in careers. Marriage and children are items to be calendared after the MBA, J.D., or Ph.D. Sex is recreation. Getting attached to the human being behind the sex organ can limit your internship options.</p>
<p>Cheerleading articles like Hanna Rosin&#8217;s 2012 <i>Atlantic</i> piece, &#8220;Boys on the Side,&#8221; argue that far from enduring the &#8220;hook-up culture,&#8221; women are enjoying their promiscuous freedom. The <i>New York Times</i> piece is in that mold.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this type of environment, anyone that embraces the &#8220;old ways&#8221; is considered to be abnormal.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/08/05/mtv-virgins/">MTV</a> plans to do a new &#8220;freaks on display&#8221; reality show about virgins that they hope will get very high ratings&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>This as-yet-untitled show follows the lives of several abstinent young people (ages 18 to 25) trying to handle their love lives, parental sex talks, sexually active friends, and the pressure to give in to their temptations. Throughout each episode, MTV chronicles v-card-carrying cast members from across the country, all “plagued with the overwhelming question of keeping their virginity… or losing it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, our entire society is rapidly rejecting traditional values regarding marriage, sex and family.  If you can believe it, Barack Obama recently even nominated someone for a federal judge position that believes that abstinence education is &#8220;<a href="http://www.trunews.com/obama-judicial-nominee-calls-abstinence-education-unconstitutional/">unconstitutional</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Our nation is rapidly changing, and not for the better.  For much more on the all-out assault on the family in America, please see my previous article entitled &#8220;<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/27-facts-that-prove-that-the-family-in-america-is-in-the-worst-shape-ever">27 Facts That Prove That The Family In America Is In The Worst Shape Ever</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>And whenever I post an article about marriage, sex or the family, it always provokes some very strong reactions.  Please feel free to share what you think by posting a comment below&#8230;</p>

<p>Thanks to Glenn Greenwald of the Guardian, we now know about XKeyscore, an NSA program that collects &#8220;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data">nearly everything that a user does on the Internet</a>&#8220;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A top secret National Security Agency program allows analysts to search with no prior authorization through vast databases containing emails, online chats and the browsing histories of millions of individuals, according to documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the documents that Greenwald has been given, NSA agents can use XKeyscore to continually intercept and analyze &#8220;an individual&#8217;s internet activity&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>XKeyscore, the documents boast, is the NSA&#8217;s &#8220;widest reaching&#8221; system developing intelligence from computer networks – what the agency calls Digital Network Intelligence (DNI). One presentation claims the program covers &#8220;nearly everything a typical user does on the internet&#8221;, including the content of emails, websites visited and searches, as well as their metadata.</p>
<p>Analysts can also use XKeyscore and other NSA systems to obtain ongoing &#8220;real-time&#8221; interception of an individual&#8217;s internet activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if you type &#8220;the wrong thing&#8221; into a search engine, the feds could literally show up on your doorstep.  One married couple up in New York recently found this out <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/google-pressure-cookers-backpacks-visit-feds-140900667.html">the hard way</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Michele Catalano was looking for information online about pressure cookers. Her husband, in the same time frame, was Googling backpacks. Wednesday morning, six men from a joint terrorism task force showed up at their house to see if they were terrorists. Which begs the question: How&#8217;d the government know what they were Googling?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, exactly how did the government know what they were putting into Google?</p>
<p>Sadly, I think that we all know the answer to that question.</p>
<p>And when the agents got to their home, they didn&#8217;t realize their mistake and leave.  Instead, they peppered the couple with questions.  The following is <a href="https://medium.com/something-like-falling/2e7d13e54724">how Michele Catalano described the experience</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]hey were peppering my husband with questions. Where is he from? Where are his parents from? They asked about me, where was I, where do I work, where do my parents live. Do you have any bombs, they asked. Do you own a pressure cooker? My husband said no, but we have a rice cooker. Can you make a bomb with that? My husband said no, my wife uses it to make quinoa. What the hell is quinoa, they asked. &#8230;</p>
<p>Have you ever looked up how to make a pressure cooker bomb? My husband, ever the oppositional kind, asked them if they themselves weren’t curious as to how a pressure cooker bomb works, if they ever looked it up. Two of them admitted they did.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this really what America is going to be like from now on?</p>
<p>We type the wrong thing into Google and the secret police come knocking on our doors?</p>
<p>Where will all of this end?</p>
<p>In Saudi Arabia, one man that set up a website that the authorities did not like was recently sentenced <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2381309/Editor-jailed-seven-years-sentenced-600-LASHES-starting-Free-Saudi-Liberals-website.html">to seven years in prison and 600 lashes</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The editor of a Saudi Arabian social website has been sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes for founding an Internet forum that violates Islamic values and propagates liberal thought, Saudi media reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Raif Badawi, who started the &#8216;Free Saudi Liberals&#8217; website to discuss the role of religion in Saudi Arabia, has been held since June 2012 on charges of cyber crime and disobeying his father &#8211; a crime in the conservative kingdom and top U.S. ally.</p></blockquote>
<p>That may sound extreme, but we are heading down a similar path.  People are going to start becoming afraid to express themselves on the Internet out of fear that they will get a visit from armed goons just like the Catalanos did.</p>
<p>This is not what America is supposed to be like.  We are supposed to be a nation that respects privacy, liberty and freedom.  Instead, our nation is rapidly being transformed into a heavily armed police state surveillance grid that is a paradise for control freaks.</p>
<p>And it is not just the Internet that we all need to be worried about.  An article <a href="http://www.321gold.com/editorials/guest/bellinger041912.html">by Lee Bellinger</a> described some more ways that &#8220;the police state&#8221; is expanding&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Grants to local governments for “FBI Mobile,” a portable biometric data collection system first deployed by the military to create IDs for urban-war-zone residents.</p>
<p>Covert naked-body scanners for checking out the general public on U.S. streets, a product being developed by Rapiscan Systems.</p>
<p>A fleet of roving backscatter scanning vans for expansion to all forms of ground travel.</p>
<p>Military-developed, next-generation Taser systems capable of stunning and incapacitating large numbers of protesters.</p>
<p>Active Denial System (ADS) “Pain Ray” for use here at home.</p>
<p>Shockwave Area Denial System, which can taser citizens within 100-meter ranges.</p>
<p>Laser Blinding Dazzler system, which causes temporary blindness in protestors.</p>
<p>Mass-deployed sedatives to incapacitate crowds.</p>
<p>Screaming Microwave system and ear-splitting noise machines for crowd control throughout the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p>For even more on this, please see my previous article entitled &#8220;<a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/10-ways-that-the-iron-grip-of-the-big-brother-prison-grid-is-tightening-on-all-of-our-lives">10 Ways That The Iron Grip Of The Big Brother Prison Grid Is Tightening On All Of Our Lives</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>In this type of an environment, even a helpless baby deer becomes <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/armed-agents-kill-harmless-baby-deer-in-raid/">a national security threat</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“It was like a SWAT team. Nine DNR agents and four deputy sheriffs, and they were all armed to the teeth,” animal shelter employee Ray Schulze told WISN-TV.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Schulze was working in the barn at the Society of St. Francis in Kenosha, Wis., when a swarm of squad cars screeched up and officers scrambled onto the property with a search warrant.</p>
<p>Were they hunting down an armed robber or escaped prisoner? Conducting a drug raid?</p>
<p>Incredibly, they were gunning for a 2-week-old baby fawn.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you guess what happened to the 2-week-old baby deer?</p>
<p>They killed it &#8211; just like they are killing our liberties and our freedoms.</p>
<p>What in the world is happening to America?</p>

<p>At this point, not too many others appear interested in saving Detroit.  Right now, there are approximately <a title="78,000 abandoned homes" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10190640/Motor-City-Detroit-files-for-bankruptcy-with-100000-creditors.html" target="_blank">78,000 abandoned buildings</a> in Detroit and about one-third of the entire city is either vacant or derelict.  People have been moving out in droves and there are only about 700,000 residents left.</p>
<p>For many Americans, Detroit is about the last place that they would want to live.  But to many Chinese, this sounds like a perfect buying opportunity.  According to a recent <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/07/29/chinese-investors-betting-on-detroit-comeback-buy-up-real-estate/">Fox News report</a>, real estate agents in Detroit are being overwhelmed with inquiries from China&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Downtown Detroit is home to one of the worst housing markets in the country, as prices of homes have collapsed and foreclosures have soared in the city’s depressed economy.</p>
<p>But some Chinese investors hungry for real estate are hoping Detroit’s losses will be their gain. After Detroit filed for bankruptcy July 18, Motor City property has been a hot topic on China’s social media platform, Weibo, according to a Quartz.com report.</p>
<p>News of the bankruptcy, coupled with a Chinese TV report in March that claimed you could buy two houses in Detroit for the same price as a pair of leather shoes, has piqued investors&#8217; interest.</p></blockquote>
<p>And these buyers appear to be quite serious.  One buyer reportedly <a href="http://qz.com/107937/the-latest-chinese-investment-craze-downtown-detroit-housing/">bought 30 properties recently</a>, and other buyers say that they want to purchase even more homes than that&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>And it appears to be translating into real interest; Caroline Chen, a real estate broker in Troy, Michigan, says she’s received “tons of calls” from people in mainland China.</p>
<p>“I have people calling and saying, ‘I’m serious—I wanna buy 100, 200 properties,’” she tells Quartz, noting that one of her colleagues recently sold 30 properties to a Chinese buyer. “They say ‘We don’t need to see them. Just pick the good ones.’”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, according to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/business/global/chinese-automakers-quietly-build-a-detroit-presence.html?pagewanted=all">the New York Times</a>, dozens of Chinese companies are moving into the city&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dozens of companies from China are putting down roots in Detroit, part of the country’s steady push into the American auto industry.</p>
<p>Chinese-owned companies are investing in American businesses and new vehicle technology, selling everything from seat belts to shock absorbers in retail stores, and hiring experienced engineers and designers in an effort to soak up the talent and expertise of domestic automakers and their suppliers.</p>
<p>While starting with batteries and auto parts, the spread of Chinese business is expected to result eventually in the sale of Chinese cars in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course this is not just happening in Detroit.  The truth is that the Chinese are buying up real estate, businesses and natural resources <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/meet-your-new-boss-buying-large-employers-will-enable-china-to-dominate-1000s-of-u-s-communities">all over the country</a>.</p>
<p>But they seem to have a particular interest in Detroit.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone should tell them that Detroit is not actually a very safe place these days.  The violent crime rate is <a title="five times higher" href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/19/news/economy/detroit-streetlights-police/index.html?iid=Lead" target="_blank">five times higher</a> than the national average, and the murder rate in Detroit is <a title="11 times higher" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100414480" target="_blank">11 times higher</a> than it is in New York City.</p>
<p>If you call the police, it takes them an average of <a title="58 minutes" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100899901/page/2" target="_blank">58 minutes</a> to respond.  And sometimes the people that are committing the crimes are actually Detroit police officers.  In fact, one Detroit police officer was involved in robbing a gas station <a href="http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/story/22949343/breaking-news-police#ixzz2aJMSYmc6">just last week</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A Good Samaritan snapped photos of what appeared to be two men impersonating police officers involved in a pistol-whipping and robbery outside a Citgo gas station on Detroit&#8217;s east side on July 21.</p>
<p>Once Fox 2 aired those photos, an even more disturbing picture developed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Several unidentified police officers were working this particular robbery case, recognized one of the suspects in the photographs as being a member of the Detroit Police Department,&#8221; Chief James Craig said Monday.</p>
<p>Now under arrest are two police sergeants, a 47-year-old officer and 20-year veteran of the Detroit Police Department and his 42-year-old buddy from the police academy, who is a former DPD cop and 17-year veteran of the St. Clair Shores Police Department. The later recently received a distinguished service award.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, they were police officers, just not working on-duty at the time,&#8221; Craig said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Detroit is a dying, bankrupt city.  There does not seem to be much hope of a turnaround for Detroit any time soon.</p>
<p>So why are the Chinese gobbling up so much real estate and so many businesses in Detroit?</p>
<p>That is a very good question.</p>

<p>By Lisa O&#8217;Carroll</p>
<p>September 27, 2013 &#8220;Information Clearing House &#8211; &#8220;The Guardian&#8221; &#8211;  Seymour Hersh has got some extreme ideas on how to fix journalism – close down the news bureaus of NBC and ABC, sack 90% of editors in publishing and get back to the fundamental job of journalists which, he says, is to be an outsider.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take much to fire up Hersh, the investigative journalist who has been the nemesis of US presidents since the 1960s and who was once described by the Republican party as “the closest thing American journalism has to a terrorist”.</p>
<p>He is angry about the timidity of journalists in America, their failure to challenge the White House and be an unpopular messenger of truth.</p>
<p>Don’t even get him started on the New York Times which, he says, spends “so much more time carrying water for Obama than I ever thought they would” – or the death of Osama bin Laden. “Nothing’s been done about that story, it’s one big lie, not one word of it is true,” he says of the dramatic US Navy Seals raid in 2011.</p>
<p>Hersh is writing a book about national security and has devoted a chapter to the bin Laden killing. He says a recent report put out by an “independent” Pakistani commission about life in the Abottabad compound in which Bin Laden was holed up would not stand up to scrutiny. “The Pakistanis put out a report, don’t get me going on it. Let’s put it this way, it was done with considerable American input. It’s a bullshit report,” he says hinting of revelations to come in his book.</p>
<p>The Obama administration lies systematically, he claims, yet none of the leviathans of American media, the TV networks or big print titles, challenge him.</p>
<p>“It’s pathetic, they are more than obsequious, they are afraid to pick on this guy [Obama],” he declares in an interview with the Guardian.</p>
<p>“It used to be when you were in a situation when something very dramatic happened, the president and the minions around the president had control of the narrative, you would pretty much know they would do the best they could to tell the story straight. Now that doesn’t happen any more. Now they take advantage of something like that and they work out how to re-elect the president.</p>
<p>He isn’t even sure if the recent revelations about the depth and breadth of surveillance by the National Security Agency will have a lasting effect.</p>
<p>Snowden changed the debate on surveillance He is certain that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden “changed the whole nature of the debate” about surveillance. Hersh says he and other journalists had written about surveillance, but Snowden was significant because he provided documentary evidence – although he is sceptical about whether the revelations will change the US government’s policy.</p>
<p>“Duncan Campbell [the British investigative journalist who broke the Zircon cover-up story], James Bamford [US journalist] and Julian Assange and me and the New Yorker, we’ve all written the notion there’s constant surveillance, but he [Snowden] produced a document and that changed the whole nature of the debate, it’s real now,” Hersh says.</p>
<p>“Editors love documents. Chicken-shit editors who wouldn’t touch stories like that, they love documents, so he changed the whole ball game,” he adds, before qualifying his remarks.</p>
<p>“But I don’t know if it’s going to mean anything in the long [run] because the polls I see in America – the president can still say to voters ‘al-Qaida, al-Qaida’ and the public will vote two to one for this kind of surveillance, which is so idiotic,” he says.</p>
<p>Holding court to a packed audience at City University in London’s summer school on investigative journalism, 76-year-old Hersh is on full throttle, a whirlwind of amazing stories of how journalism used to be; how he exposed the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, how he got the Abu Ghraib pictures of American soldiers brutalising Iraqi prisoners, and what he thinks of Edward Snowden.</p>
<p><strong>Hope of redemption</strong><br />
Despite his concern about the temerity of journalism he believes the trade still offers hope of redemption.<br />
“I have this sort of heuristic view that journalism, we possibly offer hope because the world is clearly run by total nincompoops more than ever … Not that journalism is always wonderful, it’s not, but at least we offer some way out, some integrity.”</p>
<p>His story of how he uncovered the My Lai atrocity is one of old-fashioned shoe-leather journalism and doggedness. Back in 1969, he got a tip about a 26-year-old platoon leader, William Calley, who had been charged by the army with alleged mass murder.</p>
<p>Instead of picking up the phone to a press officer, he got into his car and started looking for him in the army camp of Fort Benning in Georgia, where he heard he had been detained. From door to door he searched the vast compound, sometimes blagging his way, marching up to the reception, slamming his fist on the table and shouting: “Sergeant, I want Calley out now.”</p>
<p>Eventually his efforts paid off with his first story appearing in the St Louis Post-Despatch, which was then syndicated across America and eventually earned him the Pulitzer Prize. “I did five stories. I charged $100 for the first, by the end the [New York] Times were paying $5,000.”</p>
<p>He was hired by the New York Times to follow up the Watergate scandal and ended up hounding Nixon over Cambodia. Almost 30 years later, Hersh made global headlines all over again with his exposure of the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib.</p>
<p><strong>Put in the hours</strong><br />
For students of journalism his message is put the miles and the hours in. He knew about Abu Ghraib five months before he could write about it, having been tipped off by a senior Iraqi army officer who risked his own life by coming out of Baghdad to Damascus to tell him how prisoners had been writing to their families asking them to come and kill them because they had been “despoiled”.</p>
<p>“I went five months looking for a document, because without a document, there’s nothing there, it doesn’t go anywhere.”</p>
<p>Hersh returns to US president Barack Obama. He has said before that the confidence of the US press to challenge the US government collapsed post 9/11, but he is adamant that Obama is worse than Bush.<br />
“Do you think Obama’s been judged by any rational standards? Has Guantanamo closed? Is a war over? Is anyone paying any attention to Iraq? Is he seriously talking about going into Syria? We are not doing so well in the 80 wars we are in right now, what the hell does he want to go into another one for. What’s going on [with journalists]?” he asks.</p>
<p>He says investigative journalism in the US is being killed by the crisis of confidence, lack of resources and a misguided notion of what the job entails.</p>
<p>“Too much of it seems to me is looking for prizes. It’s journalism looking for the Pulitzer Prize,” he adds. “It’s a packaged journalism, so you pick a target like – I don’t mean to diminish because anyone who does it works hard – but are railway crossings safe and stuff like that, that’s a serious issue but there are other issues too.</p>
<p>“Like killing people, how does [Obama] get away with the drone programme, why aren’t we doing more? How does he justify it? What’s the intelligence? Why don’t we find out how good or bad this policy is? Why do newspapers constantly cite the two or three groups that monitor drone killings. Why don’t we do our own work?</p>
<p>“Our job is to find out ourselves, our job is not just to say – here’s a debate’ our job is to go beyond the debate and find out who’s right and who’s wrong about issues. That doesn’t happen enough. It costs money, it costs time, it jeopardises, it raises risks. There are some people – the New York Times still has investigative journalists but they do much more of carrying water for the president than I ever thought they would … it’s like you don’t dare be an outsider any more.”</p>
<p>He says in some ways President George Bush’s administration was easier to write about. “The Bush era, I felt it was much easier to be critical than it is [of] Obama. Much more difficult in the Obama era,” he said.</p>
<p>Asked what the solution is Hersh warms to his theme that most editors are pusillanimous and should be fired. “I’ll tell you the solution, get rid of 90% of the editors that now exist and start promoting editors that you can’t control,” he says. I saw it in the New York Times, I see people who get promoted are the ones on the desk who are more amenable to the publisher and what the senior editors want and the trouble makers don’t get promoted. Start promoting better people who look you in the eye and say ‘I don’t care what you say’.</p>
<p>Nor does he understand why the Washington Post held back on the Snowden files until it learned the Guardian was about to publish.</p>
<p>If Hersh was in charge of US Media Inc, his scorched earth policy wouldn’t stop with newspapers.<br />
“I would close down the news bureaus of the networks and let’s start all over, tabula rasa. The majors, NBCs, ABCs, they won’t like this – just do something different, do something that gets people mad at you, that’s what we’re supposed to be doing,” he says.</p>
<p>Hersh is currently on a break from reporting, working on a book which undoubtedly will make for uncomfortable reading for both Bush and Obama.</p>
<p>“The republic’s in trouble, we lie about everything, lying has become the staple.” And he implores journalists to do something about it.</p>

<p>Readers have asked that I write about Fukushima.  </p>
<p>About all I can tell you with confidence is that we are getting no more truth about Fukushima from the presstitute media than we are about any other subject.</p>
<p>As I understand it, which I hope is incorrectly, Fukushima has the prospect, if the wrong events occur, of essentially eliminating Japan as a country. </p>
<p>Why Japan, the only country to suffer attack by nuclear weapons, made the decision to rely on nuclear plants for its electricity is a mystery.  Perhaps the Japanese government was pressured by Washington to accept US nuclear energy technology as a form of tribute payment.  </p>
<p>Whether or not Japan under Washington’s thumb was a coerced market for Westinghouse, Fukushima is sending radiation into the Pacific Ocean and, apparently, into the groundwater that supplies Tokyo. </p>
<p>if the fuel rods that must be removed from a damaged building ignite, calamity will result.</p>
<p>Nuclear energy plants are now sprinkled all over the developed world. Each and every one is subject to accident. An accident, and sustainable life ends for that area of the world. </p>
<p>Consider how was it possible for the Japanese, an intelligent people, to locate the Fukushima nuclear energy plants in a tsunami coastal area. This decision shows a lack of any thought whatsoever.  Elsewhere nuclear energy plants are located on earthquake  faults.  Ongoing climate change subjects others to forest fires. </p>
<p>Have humans greedy for cheap energy destroyed the world?</p>
<p>Nuclear energy is said to be “clean.”  But, of course, radiation is not clean, and its death dealing power lasts a very long time. Will the human greed for the moment at the expense of the future exterminate all life on earth?</p>
<p>No one in the western orbit should expect any answer from the bought-and-paid-for-government.</p>

<p>Statement by H. E. Dr. Hassan Rouhani President of the Islamic Republic of Iran at the Sixty-eight Session of the United Nations General Assembly, September 24, 2013</p>
<p>Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General,  Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  <br />
 At the outset, I would like to offer my most sincere felicitations on your deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly and seize the moment to express appreciation for the valuable efforts of our distinguished Secretary-General.</p>
<p>  Our world today is replete with fear and hope; fear of war and hostile regional and global relations; fear of deadly confrontation of religious, ethnic and national identities; fear of institutionalization of violence and extremism; fear of poverty and destructive discrimination; fear of decay and destruction of life-sustaining resources; fear of disregard for human dignity and rights; and fear of neglect of morality. Alongside these fears, however, there are new hopes; the hope of universal acceptance by the people and the elite all across the globe of &#8220;yes to peace and no to war&#8221;; and the hope of preference of dialogue over conflict, and moderation over extremism.</p>
<p> The recent elections in Iran represent a clear, living example of the wise choice of hope, rationality and moderation by the great people of Iran. The realization of democracy consistent with religion and the peaceful transfer of executive power manifested that Iran is the anchor of stability in an otherwise ocean of regional instabilities. The firm belief of our people and government in enduring peace, stability, tranquility, peaceful resolution of disputes and reliance on the ballot box as the basis of power, public acceptance and legitimacy, has indeed played a key role in creating such a safe environment.</p>
<p>  Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,  The current critical period of transition in international relations is replete with dangers, albeit with unique opportunities. Any miscalculation of one&#8217;s position, and of course, of others, will bear historic damages; a mistake by one actor will have negative impact on all others. Vulnerability is now a global and indivisible phenomenon.</p>
<p>  At this sensitive juncture in the history global relations, the age of zero-sum games is over, even though a few actors still tend to rely on archaic and deeply ineffective ways and means to preserve their old superiority and domination. Militarism and the recourse to violent and military means to subjugate others are failed examples of the perpetuation of old ways in new circumstances.</p>
<p>  Coercive economic and military policies and practices geared to the maintenance and preservation of old superiorities and dominations have been pursued in a conceptual mindset that negates peace, security, human dignity, and exalted human ideals. Ignoring differences between societies and globalizing Western values as universal ones represent another manifestation of this conceptual mindset. Yet another reflection of the same cognitive model is the persistence of Cold War mentality and bi-polar division of the world into &#8220;superior us&#8221; and &#8220;inferior others.&#8221; Fanning fear and phobia around the emergence of new actors on the world scene is another.</p>
<p>  In such an environment, governmental and non-governmental, religious, ethnic, and even racial violence has increased, and there is no guarantee that the era of quiet among big powers will remain immune from such violent discourses, practices and actions. The catastrophic impact of violent and extremist narratives should not &#8211; in fact, must not &#8211; be underestimated.</p>
<p>  In this context, the strategic violence, which is manifested in the efforts to deprive regional players from their natural domain of action, containment policies, regime change from outside, and the efforts towards redrawing of political borders and frontiers, is extremely dangerous and provocative. </p>
<p> The prevalent international political discourse depicts a civilized center surrounded by un-civilized peripheries. In this picture, the relation between the center of world power and the peripheries is hegemonic. The discourse assigning the North the center stage and relegating the South to the periphery has led to the establishment of a monologue at the level of international relations. The creation of illusory identity distinctions and the current prevalent violent forms of xenophobia are the inevitable outcome of such a discourse. Propagandistic and unfounded faithphobic, Islamo-phobic, Shia-phobic, and Iran-phobic discourses do indeed represent serious threats against world peace and human security. </p>
<p> This propagandistic discourse has assumed dangerous proportions through portrayal and inculcation of presumed imaginary threats. One such imaginary threat is the so-called &#8220;Iranian threat&#8221; -which has been employed as an excuse to justify a long catalogue of crimes and catastrophic practices over the past three decades. The arming of the Saddam Hussein regime with chemical weapons and supporting the Taliban and A1-Qaida are just two examples of such catastrophes. Let me say this in all sincerity before this august world assembly, that based on irrefutable evidence, those who harp on the so-called threat of Iran are either a threat against international peace and security themselves or promote such a threat. Iran poses absolutely no threat to the world or the region. In Fact, in ideals as well as in actual practice, my country has been a harbinger of just peace and comprehensive security. </p>
<p> Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,  Nowhere in the world has violence been so deadly and destructive as in North Africa and West Asia. Military intervention in Afghanistan, Saddam Hussein&#8217;s imposed war against Iran, occupation of Kuwait, military interventions against Iraq, brutal repression of the Palestinian people, assassination of common people and political figures in Iran, and terrorist bombings in countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon are examples of violence in this region in the last three decades. </p>
<p> What has been &#8211; and continues to be &#8211; practiced against the innocent people of Palestine is nothing less than structural violence. Palestine is under occupation; the basic rights of the Palestinians are tragically violated, and they are deprived of the right of return and access to their homes, birthplace and homeland. Apartheid as a concept can hardly describe the crimes and the institutionalized aggression against the innocent Palestinian people. </p>
<p> The human tragedy in Syria represents a painful example of catastrophic spread of violence and extremism in our region. From the very outset of the crisis and when some regional and international actors helped to militarize the situation through infusion of arms and intelligence into the country and active support of extremist groups, we emphasized that there was no military solution to the Syrian crisis. Pursuit of expansionist strategies and objectives and attempts to change the regional balance through proxies cannot be camouflaged behind humanitarian rhetoric. The common objective of the international community should be a quick end to the killing of the innocent. While condemning any use of chemical weapons, we welcome Syria&#8217;s acceptance of the Chemical Weapons Convention, and believe that the access by extremist terrorist groups to such weapons is the greatest danger to the region that must be considered in any disarmament plan. Simultaneously, I should underline that illegitimate and ineffective threat to use or the actual use of force will only lead to further exacerbation of violence and crisis in the region. </p>
<p> Terrorism and the killing of innocent people represent the ultimate inhumanity of extremism and violence. Terrorism is a violent scourge and knows no country or national borders. But, the violence and extreme actions such as the use of drones against innocent people in the name of combating terrorism should also be condemned. Here, I should also say a word about the criminal assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists. For what crimes have they been assassinated? The United Nations and the Security Council should answer the question: have the perpetrators been condemned? </p>
<p>  Unjust sanctions, as manifestation of structural violence, are intrinsically inhumane and against peace. And contrary to the claims of those who pursue and impose them, it is not the states and the political elite that are targeted, but rather, it is the common people who are victimized by these sanctions. Let us not forget millions of Iraqis who, as a result of sanctions covered in international legal jargon, suffered and lost their lives, and many more who continue to suffer all through their lives. These sanctions are violent, pure and simple; whether called smart or otherwise, unilateral or multilateral. These sanctions violate inalienable human rights, inter alia, the right to peace, fight to development, right to access to health and education, and above all, the right to life. Sanctions, beyond any and all rhetoric, cause belligerence, warmongering and human suffering. It should be borne in mind, however, that the negative impact is not merely limited to the intended victims of sanctions; it also affects the economy and livelihood of other countries and societies, including the countries imposing sanctions. </p>
<p> Mr. President, Excellencies,  Violence and extremism nowadays have gone beyond the physical realm and have unfortunately afflicted and tarnished the mental and spiritual dimensions of life in human societies. Violence and extremism leave no space for understanding and moderation as the necessary foundations of collective life of human beings and the modem society. Intolerance is the predicament of our time. We need to promote and reinforce tolerance in light of the religious teachings and appropriate cultural and political approaches. The human society should be elevated from a state of mere tolerance to that of collective collaboration. We should not just tolerate others. We should rise above mere tolerance and dare to work together. </p>
<p> People all over the world are tired of war, violence and extremism. They hope for a change in the status quo. And this is a unique opportunity &#8211; for us all. The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that all challenges can be managed &#8211; successfully &#8211; through a smart, judicious blend of hope and moderation. Warmongers are bent on extinguishing all hope. But hope for change for the better is an innate, religious, widespread, and universal concept.</p>
<p>  Hope is founded on the belief in the universal will of the people across the globe to combat violence and extremism, to cherish change, to oppose imposed structures, to value choice, and to act in accordance with human responsibility. Hope is no doubt one of the greatest gifts bestowed upon human beings by their All-Loving Creator. And moderation is to think and move in a wise, judicious manner, conscious of the time and the space, and to align exalted ideals with choice of effective strategies and policies, while cognizant of objective realities. </p>
<p> The Iranian people, in a judiciously sober choice in the recent elections, voted for the discourse of hope, foresight and prudent moderation &#8211; both at home and abroad. In foreign policy, the combination of these elements means that the Islamic Republic of Iran, as a regional power, will act responsibly with regard to regional and international security, and is willing and prepared to cooperate in these fields, bilaterally as well as multilaterally, with other responsible actors. We defend peace based on democracy and the ballot box everywhere, including in Syria, Bahrain, and other countries in the region, and believe that there are no violent solutions to world crises. The bitter and ugly realities of the human society can only be overcome through recourse to and reliance on human wisdom, interaction and moderation. Securing peace and democracy and ensuring the legitimate rights of all countries in the world, including in the Middle East, cannot &#8211; and will not &#8211; be realized through militarism. </p>
<p> Iran seeks to resolve problems, not to create them. There is no issue or dossier that cannot be resolved through reliance on hope and prudent moderation, mutual respect, and rejection of violence and extremism. Iran&#8217;s nuclear dossier is a case in point. </p>
<p>As clearly stated by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, acceptance of the inalienable right of Iran constitutes the best and the easiest way of resolving this issue. This is not political rhetoric. Rather, it is based on a profound recognition of the state of technology in Iran, global political environment, the end of the era of zero-sum games, and the imperative of seeking common objectives and interests towards reaching common understanding and shared security. Put otherwise, Iran and other actors should pursue two common objectives as two mutually inseparable parts of a political solution for the nuclear dossier of Iran. </p>
<p>Iran&#8217;s nuclear program &#8211; and for that matter, that of all other countries &#8211; must pursue exclusively peaceful purposes. I declare here, openly and unambiguously, that, notwithstanding the positions of others, this has been, and will always be, the objective of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Nuclear weapon and other weapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran&#8217;s security and defense doctrine, and contradict our fundamental religious and ethical convictions. Our national interests make it imperative that we remove any and all reasonable concerns about Iran&#8217;s peaceful nuclear program. </p>
<p>The second objective, that is, acceptance of and respect for the implementation of the right to enrichment inside Iran and enjoyment of other related nuclear rights, provides the only path towards achieving the first objective. Nuclear knowledge in Iran has been domesticated now and the nuclear technology, inclusive of enrichment, has already reached industrial scale. It is, therefore, an illusion, and extremely unrealistic, to presume that the peaceful nature of the nuclear program of Iran could be ensured through impeding the program via illegitimate pressures. </p>
<p> In this context, the Islamic Republic of Iran, insisting on the implementation of its rights and the imperative of international respect and cooperation in this exercise, is prepared to engage immediately in time-bound and result-oriented talks to build mutual confidence and removal of mutual uncertainties with full transparency. </p>
<p> Iran seeks constructive engagement with other countries based on mutual respect and common interest, and within the same framework does not seek to increase tensions with the United States. I listened carefully to the statement made by President Obama today at the General Assembly. Commensurate with the political will of the leadership in the United States and hoping that they will refrain from following the short-sighted interest of warmongering pressure groups, we can arrive at a framework to manage our differences. To this end, equal footing, mutual respect, and the recognized principles of international law should govern the interactions. Of course, we expect to hear a consistent voice from Washington. </p>
<p> Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,  In recent years, a dominant voice has been repeatedly heard: &#8220;The military option is on the table.&#8221; Against the backdrop of this illegal and ineffective contention, let me say loud and clear that &#8220;peace is within reach.&#8221; So, in the name of the Islamic Republic of Iran I propose, as a starting step, the consideration by the United Nations of the project: &#8220;the World Against Violence and Extremism.&#8221; (WAVE) Let us all join this &#8220;WAVE.&#8221; I invite all states, international organizations and civil institutions to undertake a new effort to guide the world in this direction. We should start thinking about &#8220;Coalition for Enduing Peace&#8221; all across the globe instead of the ineffective &#8220;Coalitions for War&#8221; in various parts of the world. </p>
<p> Today, the Islamic Republic of Iran invites you and the entire world community to take a step forward; an invitation to join the WAVE: World Against Violence and Extremism. We should accept and be able to open a new horizon in which peace will prevail over war, tolerance over violence, progress over bloodletting, justice over discrimination, prosperity over poverty, and freedom over despotism. As beautifully said by Ferdowsi, the renowned Iranian epic poet:  </p>
<p> Be relentless in striving for the cause of Good Bring the spring, you must, Banish the winter, you should. </p>
<p> Notwithstanding all difficulties and challenges, I am deeply optimistic about the future. I have no doubt that the future will be bright with the entire world solidly rejecting violence and extremism. Prudent moderation will ensure a bright future for the world.

<p>Washington’s Tyranny</p>
<p>Paul Craig Roberts</p>
<p>The war criminal barack obama has declared his “outrage” over the 62 deaths associated with the takeover of a Nairobi, Kenya, shopping mall by al-Shabaab fighters.  But the attack on the shopping mall was obama’s fault.  Al Shabaab spokesmen said that the attack on the Nairobi mall was a retaliatory response to the Kenyan troops sent to fight against them in Somalia.  The Kenyan troops, of course, were sent to Somalia as a result of pressure from Washington. </p>
<p>Just as the outbreak of violence in Mali resulted from the fighters that obama used against Gaddafi moving into Mali, Washington’s violence against Somalia has resulted in the terrorist attack on the Nairobi mall.  </p>
<p>This fact again raises the never asked question:  What is the real agenda of Washington’s “war on terror”?  The western presstitutes never ask this question, nor do western legislative bodies.  </p>
<p>Washington has offered a variety of justifications for its twelve years of wars. One is that<br />
Washington is rooting out terrorism in order to protect Americans from 9/11 type events.  Another is that “dictators” must be overthrown and replaced with “freedom and democracy.”  Still another is false claims of the possession of “weapons of mass destruction” (Iraq) and the use of “weapons of mass destruction” (Syria).  </p>
<p>None of Washington’s claims can withstand the barest scrutiny.  None of the governments that Washington has overthrown and seeks to overthrow are terrorist states.  Indeed, some are not even Islamist governments. Saddam Hussein’s Iraq had a secular government, as does Assad’s Syria. </p>
<p>Washington’s explanations for murdering Pakistanis and Yemenis with drones are even more nebulous.  Moreover, using military means to kill citizens of countries with which the US is not at war lacks all legality.  </p>
<p>When obama gets on the moral high horse about deaths in Syria or Nairobi, his hypocrisy is astounding. A person would think obama would be ashamed.  The Egyptian military, which is financed with $2 billion annually from Washington, has just overthrown the first elected president in Egypt’s history, banned the political party that Egyptians elected to power, and confiscated the political party’s assets, money, and buildings. </p>
<p>The Washington sponsored Egyptian military shot down in the streets many more Egyptians protesting the overthrow of their government by a military coup than died in the Nairobi mall. But we hear nothing from Washington or obama about the need to support democracy in Egypt.  </p>
<p>When the British Parliament voted down providing cover for obama’s criminal attack on Syria, Parliament created space for Russia’s President Putin to resolve the Syrian situation by obtaining Syrian President Assad’s agreement to join the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and to turn over all Syrian chemical weapons to an international body.  </p>
<p>The war monger obama regime was outraged that Washington’s military attack on Syria had been blocked.  Washington and the Israel Lobby went into full scale demonization of President Putin for orchestrating peace instead of war. The obama regime is trying to block the agreement by insisting on incorporating into the UN resolution an opportunity for attacking Syria if Washington is not convinced that all chemical weapons are turned over.  </p>
<p>The entire world knows that Washington will again lie through its teeth, assert that all the weapons were not turned over and use the wedge that Washington is attempting to force into the UN resolution to start another war.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has publicly stated that Washington is trying to blackmail Russia into accepting the potential for military intervention in Syria as part of the agreement.  </p>
<p>Until the 21st century, Washington carried out its relentless nefarious activities against other peoples and countries under cover and out of sight.  In the 21st century the criminal bush and obama regimes have brazenly demonstrated their disregard for US law, international law, and human rights. </p>
<p>Hubris and arrogance have run away with the “superpower.”  The US stands reviled by the world. At the UN summit on September 23, the president of Brazil denounced the obama regime for its “breach of international law” revealed by the spy scandal. Bolivian President Evo Morales is filing a lawsuit against the obama regime for “crimes against humanity.”</p>
<p>When the world looks at Washington, it cannot differentiate Washington from the dictatorships that Washington attributes to other countries. The Washington regime has declared that it is above both law and Constitution and possesses the power to detain citizens indefinitely and to murder them without due process of law.  These powers comprise the necessary and sufficient conditions for dictatorship. </p>
<p>Who will liberate Americans from Washington’s tyranny, overthrow the executive branch dictatorship, and bring freedom and democracy to America? </p>

<p>The American poor are being driven into the ground. Not only is owning a home out of the question, but also the poor can’t even afford to rent.  They lack the money for a damage deposit, and they lack the cash for the large deposits that utility companies require in order to have utilities connected.</p>
<p>The declining ability of the poor to rent is adversely affecting those who provide rental shelter to the poor.</p>
<p>For the dispossessed middle class, foreclosure on a home is often just the beginning of trouble. If, for example, a bank forecloses on a home with a $200,000 mortgage and sells the house for $100,000, under some circumstances the IRS treats the $100,000 difference as income to the foreclosed homeowner and requires the bank to issue a 1099 form to the homeowner showing taxable income of $100,000. <a href='http://www.irs.gov/uac/Home-Foreclosure-and-Debt-Cancellation'  target="_blank">http://www.irs.gov/uac/Home-Foreclosure-and-Debt-Cancellation</a>  </p>
<p>Alternatively, if the sale does not cover the mortgage, the bank can come after other property that the foreclosed homeowner might possess, such as a second home, car, work equipment, checking account balance.  For example, a construction subcontractor who loses his home and moves his family into the office or construction trailer on the lot where he keeps the backhoe loader and work truck can find himself dispossessed of these assets in order to apply the proceeds to the difference between his mortgage and the price at which the bank sells his foreclosed home.</p>
<p>Americans who have not been personally affected by foreclosure have little idea how the system is rigged in favor of the banks that caused the problem and against the victims of financial deregulation.</p>
<p>In the article below, Jeffrey St. Clair and Alexander Cockburn show that the assault on the poor began with the Clinton administration.  </p>

Welfare Reform and an Ever-Expanding Police State<br />
The Origins of the Neoliberal War on the Poor<br />
by JEFFREY ST. CLAIR and ALEXANDER COCKBURN</p>
<p>In November of 1994 two years of ramshackle government, breached pledges and the Clinton administration’s frequently manifested contempt for its traditional base, exacted their price. In the midterm elections Republicans seized control of both the House and the Senate for the first time since the Eisenhower era. The rout extended to governors’ mansions across the country, where the Republicans captured the majority of governorships for the first time in a quarter-century. Newt Gingrich, the new Speaker of the House, became the nation’s political wunderkind.</p>
<p>Yet for Bill Clinton the Democratic defeat held its paradoxical allure. The old-line Democratic Congressional leadership no longer held sway on the Hill. Tom Foley and Dan Rostenkowski were gone altogether–one back to the Inland Empire of the Pacific Northwest and the other to a federal penitentiary. The White House no longer had to dicker with hostility to its agenda from New Deal-oriented Democrats. Without the threat of a presidential veto to lend clout to their resistance, the liberal Democrats on the Hill were impotent against the Republicans flourishing their Contract with America. Thus unencumbered, the Clinton administration could cut deals with the Republican leadership.</p>
<p>All this strategy needed was a name, and soon after the election Bill Clinton summoned in the man who would introduce “triangulation” into the lexicon of the late 1990s.</p>
<p>Dick Morris, a man of elastic political scruple, had enjoyed a fluctuating relationship with Clinton. He’d bailed out the young governor of Arkansas after the latter’s first comeuppance at the hands of the voters in 1980. Since then Morris had served many masters, ranging from the millionaire socialist from Ohio, Howard Metzenbaum, to Bella Abzug of New York, to Trent Lott of Mississippi (“I love his feisty, shit-on-the-shoes style”) and Jesse Helms of North Carolina. Morris worked as a consultant for Helms in 1990, in a particularly foul campaign against the black Democratic challenger, Harvey Gantt.</p>
<p>Morris came to the White House with the purpose of providing new ideas and a new strategy. He says Clinton told him, “I’ve lost confidence in my current team.” Morris commenced his mission of refreshment under conditions of secrecy, code-named Charlie, his function at first known only to the Clintons. His advice: steal the Republicans’ thunder, draw down the deficit, reform welfare, cut back government regulation and “use Gore’s reinventing government program to cut the public sector’s size.” The president should demonstrate toughness, Morris counseled, with decisive action overseas.</p>
<p>As the new Republican leadership took over in January of 1995, Clinton summoned Gore to the Oval Office, disclosed the hiring of Morris and instructed the vice president to work with him. “Charlie” then laid out the new agenda for Gore. Morris later wrote, “He grasped what I was saying at once and offered his full supportGore told me that he had been increasingly troubled by the drift of the White HouseHe said he had tried, in vain, to move the administration toward the center, but the White House staff had shut him outGore said, ‘We need a change here, a big change, and I’m hoping and praying that you’re the man to bring it.’ We shook hands on our alliance.”</p>
<p>Soon Morris, Gore and Clinton came to two fateful decisions. As part of the strategy of stealing the Republicans’ thunder, Morris urged an intensive fundraising drive, aimed at amassing “soft money” for TV spots designed to boost the new Clinton agenda, trump the Republicans and detour the old-line concerns of the Democrats at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Soft money earns that much-abused name because it can be raised in amounts not limited by campaign spending laws; it can be procured directly from corporations, labor unions or other institutions so long as the money is used to promote “issues” rather than specific candidates. That at least is how the law supposed soft money would work. Morris knew very well that the issue ads would be identified directly with Clinton, because they would sound themes Morris himself had prescribed. To execute these ads Morris and Gore turned to the latter’s longtime media consultant, Bob Squier. Down the road lay many a funding scandal, not least the Buddhist temple imbroglio that found Al Gore on the receiving end of thousands of dollars in contributions from monks and nuns supposedly ennobled by the spiritual distinction of poverty. But such things were still a year away.</p>
<p>The time had come to go public with the new line. Morris drafted a speech for Clinton in which the president would announce that he was ready to work with the Republicans. It laid out the grounds on which the President was prepared to meet Newt Gingrich. Within the White House there was a storm of protest, led by Leon Panetta, Clinton’s chief of staff and onetime California congressman, who was aghast at what he correctly perceived to be the betrayal of his former colleagues on the Hill.</p>
<p>As Panetta presented his case, Clinton began to tilt toward his position. Morris sensed crisis at hand. At the crucial moment, so he relates, Gore, who had been silently following the debate, made a decisive intervention. “I agree with Dick’s point, that we need to emerge from the shadows and place ourselves at the center of the debate with the Republicans by articulating what we will accept and what we will not in a clear and independent way.” It was music to Morris’s ears, and he cried, “Bravo!”<br />
For Morris, as for his employer, polls were everything. He developed what he called a “neuro-psychological profile” of the American voter, and established an iron rule that no initiative could be undertaken by the White House unless polling showed an approval rating of 60 percent. By constant polling he concocted what he called a “values agenda”. At the top of the list was affirmative action. “Mend it, don’t end it” was the mantra, which meant, in practice, destroy affirmative action from the inside while professing support for the general principle.</p>
<p>Next came TV violence. Intimidate the networks, Morris advised, into adopting a “voluntary” system of ratings for TV shows and movies. Soon media executives were summoned to the White House for a session with Clinton and Gore. Simultaneously Clinton pushed for installation of the so-called V-chip in all new TV sets, which would allow parents to block all offensive material. Next came teen pregnancy, an issue pounded on by the Clinton White House, even though the rate had been falling. Education: go after tenured teachers, an attack increasingly popular in Morris’s focus groups, and demand that at least they be tested. Youth: advocate school uniforms and curfews for teens. Gay marriage: on Morris’s advice Clinton and Gore embraced the Defense of Marriage Act, a purely grandstanding piece of legislation which preemptively bars gay marriages from recognition under federal law for any purpose. Immigration: the poll numbers were off the chart, and the Clinton White House duly set a goal to double the number of turn-backs by the Immigration and Naturalization Service–among other things, enlisting the Labor Department to help speed the pace and breadth of workplace raids. Taxes: Morris believed that Main Street America was now playing the market, so that a 20 percent reduction in the capital gains tax rate would be hugely popular.</p>
<p>But there were two issues that towered above the rest in Morris’s assaying of public opinion: welfare and crime. In the 1992 campaign, Clinton had pledged to “end welfare as we know it.” In 1993, Gore had urged Clinton to declare war on welfare as part of the first 100 days and had implored the president to let him lead the charge. After all, Gore argued, he was one of the few Democratic senators to have supported a welfare-to-work law narrowly approved in 1988, forcing states to require parents getting welfare checks to work at least 16 hours per week in unpaid jobs. But Hillary thought an attack on welfare would divert energy from her health care package, and Gore lost the battle.</p>
<p>By 1995 the welfare rolls were shrinking, from a peak of 18 million in the recession of 1991 to about 12.8 million. Defenders of the system in Clinton’s cabinet, Labor Secretary Robert Reich and Donna Shalala of Heath and Human Services, argued that the total budget for Aid to Families with Dependent Children was a tiny fraction of the federal budget; indeed, it was only 14 percent of the amount devoted to Medicare, a middle-class entitlement. The real problem, they argued, was lack of training for the chronically underemployed and unemployed.</p>
<p>Reflexively hostile to welfare and fortified by Morris’s polls, Clinton pressed ahead. The administration began granting waivers to states to implement their own onslaughts on welfare, feature “workfare” requirements, time limits and “family caps”, a punishment for women who dared to have more than the approved number of children the government would help support. Through 1995 and early in 1996 the Republicans had passed and sent to Clinton two bills to dismantle the federal welfare system. He vetoed both, but in his veto messages he stressed that he agreed with much of their content in principle. Peter Edelman, a high level official at HHS, described this as “the squeeze play”, whereby Clinton would reap approval from Democratic New Dealers for standing up for poor kids while at the same time signaling that in the long run he’d throw the mothers of those kids off the rolls altogether.</p>
<p>As they approached the Democratic convention in the summer of 1996, Clinton was floating on Morris’s magic carpet. Assisted by staggering blunders by Gingrich and a lackluster opponent in Bob Dole, Clinton was ahead by no less than 27 percent in the polls. The Republicans were eager to wrap up their legislative work before the conventions in July and August. They pushed through a welfare bill arguably worse than the ones Clinton had vetoed previously. Many Democrats on the Hill believed that Clinton would veto this bill too. But Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York had more sensitive political antennae. He warned, “I’ve heard that the leaders of the cabinet recommended a veto but that the president remains under the sway of his pollsters.”</p>
<p>On July 30, 1996, Clinton mustered his cabinet to hear arguments on whether or not he should sign the Republicans’ bill. One by one his advisers said he should not. No’s from people like Shalala and Reich came as no surprise. But similarly disapproving were not only Leon Panetta but Laura Tyson, his chief economic adviser, Henry Cisneros of HUD and even Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who said that too many people would be harmed by the bill and that it show an act of political courage to veto it.<br />
Not trusting Shalala’s department to produce objective assessments of the consequences of the bill, the White House staff had commissioned a survey from the Urban Institute, a DC think tank. The numbers were dire. The bill would push 2.6 million people further into poverty–1.1 million of them children. In all, the Institute predicted that 11 million families would lose income. That was the best-case scenario. In the event of a recession (which would come in 2001), the numbers would be far, far worse. In that fateful cabinet meeting Rubin invoked this study, and the numbers seemed to find their mark with Clinton, while Gore remained mute.</p>
<p>The meeting came to an end and Clinton, Panetta and Gore headed for the Oval Office for a private session. All accounts agree that, first, Panetta again made the case for a veto, laying particular emphasis on an appalling provision in the bill that would deny legal immigrants federal assistance, such as food stamps. Finally Gore broke his silence and urged Clinton to sign.<br />
Clinton, Morris and Gore prepared a press statement, delivered by the president later that same day. Clinton admitted that the bill contained “serious flaws” but went on to say, “This is the best chance we will have in a long time to complete the work of ending welfare as we know it.” No one at the press conference quizzed<br />
￼<br />
Clinton on this curious claim. After all, the election was only about three months away. By early fall of 1996 it was clear The Democrats had a chance of regaining the House. Would not that recapture afford a better chance of crafting a welfare bill not compromised by Gingrich and the others?</p>
<p>To this day many Democrats in Congress become incensed on the topic of what Clinton and Gore did. One the eve of a Democratic convention, with Gingrich already ensconced in the national imagination as the Bad Guy, Clinton had just made common cause with him, thus undercutting all plans to campaign against the Gingrich Congress. As for Al Gore the consensus was that he was looking ahead to a possible challenge in 2000 from his old rival Dick Gephardt. With Morris’s polls showing that an attack on welfare scored well over the 60 percent bar, Gore would have the advantage over Gephardt or any other liberal challenger.</p>
<p>Suspicions about Gore deepened as the fall campaign proceeded. The president and vice president argued that it was crucial that they be re-elected so that they fix the problems with the welfare bill they had just signed. The problems here concerned not the welfare bill itself but the denial of federal services to legal immigrants and a slash in the food stamp program. In October of 1996, with the presidential election no longer in doubt, Democratic candidates came to the Democratic National Committee urgently seeking infusions of cash to help them in the crucial final weeks. Finally, Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, then the general chairman of the DNC, organized a meeting with Clinton and Gore. Dodd explained that the two were home safe and there was a chance to recapture the House. Clinton seemed amenable to a release of funds. Gore adamantly disagreed. On one account, Gore was the only person in the White House to oppose this transfer of funds from the presidential campaign to congressional races. It’s a measure of how a number of Democrats view Al Gore that some participants in that meeting felt that the only explanation for his conduct was that he did not want the Democrats to re-take control of the House because victory would elevate Gephardt to Speaker of the House.</p>
<p>The cynicism may not have stopped there. Why did Clinton and Gore decide to sign on to that third Republican welfare bill? The only major difference from the previous ones came in the form of the denial of federal services to legal immigrants and a $2.5 billion cut in the food stamp program. It’s likely that these two Republican add-ons were what allured the White House, because (as noted above) Clinton could then turn to the liberals saying they needed him to be re-elected so he could repair part of the damage wrought by the very bill he had just signed. In fact the White House probably could have insisted the riders be dropped, because Dole desperately wanted a legislative victory under the Republicans’ belt.</p>
<p>The welfare bill ended a federal entitlement that had been a cornerstone of the New Deal. It caps the federal contribution to welfare programs at $14.6 billion a year and hands the money over in block grants to the states to distribute as they see fit. The main requirement is that the states agree that welfare recipients can spend no more than a total of five years in their lifetime on welfare. It allows states to adopt even harsher standards. Finally, under the old system, welfare money came to the recipient as cash. Under the new system, the money can be given to intermediaries, for possible conversion to other services such as housing or food. Al Gore particularly liked this provision. In Atlanta in May of 1999, he told an audience why: “It allows faith-based organizations to provide basic welfare services. They can do so with public funds–without having to alter the religious character that is so often the key to their effectiveness. We should extend this approach to drug treatment, homelessness and youth violence prevention. People who work in faith-and values-based organizations are driven by their spiritual commitment. They have done what government can never do: provide compassionate care. Their client is not a number but a child of god.” In other words, treat welfare payments like school vouchers. Gore had just laid out the welcome mat for Bush’s faith-based initiatives.</p>
<p>Not long after Clinton signed the welfare bill, judgment came from Senator Moynihan, who had begun his service to the state back in the sixties with sermons about the “pathology” of the black family and now, bizarrely, was defending the system he’d denounced for years. Even this man of all seasons and all masters was shocked: “It is a social risk no sane person would take, and I mean that. If you think things can’t get worse, just wait until there are a third of a million people on the streets It’s not welfare reform; it’s welfare repeal.”</p>
<p>Hugh Price, president of the National Urban League, called the bill “an abomination for America’s most vulnerable mothers and children” and accused Clinton, Gore and the Congress of defecting from a war on poverty and “waging a war against poor people instead.”</p>
<p>Within weeks three high-ranking officials in the Department of Health and Human Services had resigned: Mary Jo Bane, Walter Primus and Peter Edelman. That was it. Across the length and breadth of the Clinton administration, only these resignations were tendered in principle against this abandonment of the New Deal and the shafting of America’s poor. Since that time Edelman has missed no opportunity to denounce the bill as a punitive strike against defenseless people. “The bill closes its eyes to all the facts and complexities of the real world and essentially says to recipients: find a job.”</p>
<p>The edict “find a job” was central to the bill and to the mythology nourished by opponents of welfare-that freeloaders with jobs available to them were abusing the system. Of course, there is always some abuse, but study after study had shown that most welfare recipients had looked for jobs and couldn’t find a suitable one or had been on welfare for a limited period, then found a job and got off the rolls. In 1999 a University of Michigan study making an assessment three years after the welfare bill went into effect found that the welfare population faces “unusually high barriers to work: such as physical and mental health problems, domestic violence and lack of transportation.” More than 30 percent of the families on welfare are constrained by disability, a sick child, no child care or an infirm relative. Those that want to find work are faced with narrow options even in an economy hyped as in mid-boom. In 1996 the Congressional Budget Office offered some bleak realities about the reserve army of the unemployed. With an official unemployment rate of four percent (the unofficial rate is roughly twice that, since government figures don’t count frustrated people who have given up looking for work), there are still three to five people needing work for each available job. In the Bush recession, this ratio rose to more than 10 to one.</p>
<p>In urban areas the job market is even more constricted. A 1998 study in Harlem showed just how brutally competitive the low-wage job market is. Over a five-month period, an average of fourteen people applied for each job opening at a local McDonalds. A year later researchers from the University of Chicago found that 73 percent of those same job searchers still hadn’t found even minimum wage level work.</p>
<p>In many states, there’s the last resort of workfare, which compels welfare recipients to accept public jobs, such as highway clean-up or garbage picking with the Parks Department, in return for benefits. Nationally the average benefit for workfare jobs is $381 per month, which works out to $4.40 an hour, or 80 percent of the minimum wage. But in some places it’s much worse. Mississippi, for example, requires single mothers to work twenty hours a week at $1.38 an hour, and a two-parent household to work fifty-five hours at 50 cents an hour.</p>
<p>On top of this the people in the workfare labor force are denied such basic rights as collective bargaining, unemployment insurance, the earned income tax credit and Social Security credit. States are finding it to their budgetary advantage to fill job vacancies with these “slavefare” workers. A Senate study in 1996 estimated that the consequences of welfare reform would depress the wages of the working poor by 12 percent.</p>
<p>Allowing the states to freelance their welfare programs has resulted in some particularly cruel policies and inequities. Minnesota spends $50 million a year on child care for single mothers receiving welfare benefits who are working or looking for work. New York spends $54 million to serve a population six times as large. Clinton and Gore repeatedly touted the approach taken by Indiana, where welfare reform was instituted by a Democratic governor, Evan Bayh, and his successor in the governor’s mansion, Frank O’Bannon. The pair presided over the shrinking of the welfare rolls in the Hoosier state by 30 percent. There’s no way to know if those people actually found work. It’s possible that the conditions of supervision of welfare recipients simply became unbearable and they left the program and perhaps the state. Under Indiana’s scheme, one missed job-training course means the loss of a welfare check for two months. A second infraction means loss of benefits for a year. A third strike and you’re out for good.</p>
<p>The Clinton welfare bill also includes a provision that allows states to begin drug testing welfare recipients. In theory the provision was aimed at people suspected of having drug problems. Oregon, for example, initiated a testing policy but soon reversed course when recipients began dropping out of the welfare program to avoid testing. The state found that it was better to stop drug testing, keep people in the program and steer addicts into treatment. Michigan took a different approach. In 1999 the state adopted a mandatory drug-testing policy for all welfare recipients, which prompted a lawsuit by the ACLU. A federal judge ruled in 1999 that the policy was unconstitutional. He noted that in the five weeks of the program’s operation there were positive drug tests in only eight percent of the cases, and all but three of those were for marijuana.</p>
<p>In his 2000 campaign, Al Gore pushed for what he called “Welfare Reform 2″, saying that more remained to be done to weed out cheats and freeloaders. He was particularly vehement in attacking dads behind on child support, vowing that he would make it easier for credit care companies to deny credit to such fathers. This would have come on top of a program, initiated by Janet Reno in her Florida years, whereby fathers behind on their payments get their driver’s license lifted, meaning that they can’t drive to work. In 1995, Clinton, Gore and Morris put into operation a program that saw these father’s mug shots put up in Post Offices, their federal benefits garnished and the IRS sent on their trail. This pattern of inflicting administrative conviction outside the court system and due process is integral to the Clinton/Gore philosophy on crime.</p>
<p>The Clinton crime bill of 1994 introduced mandatory life imprisonment for persons convicted of a third felony in certain categories. It maintained the 100-to-1 disproportion in sentencing for crimes involving powder and crack cocaine, even though the US Sentencing Commission had concluded that the disparity was racist. It expanded to fifty the number of crimes that could draw the death penalty in a federal court, reaching even to crimes that did not include murders–the largest expansion of the death penalty in history. Pell grants giving prisoners an avenue to higher education were cut off. Federal judges were stripped of their powers to enforce the constitutional rights of prisoners and the power of states to set sentencing standards for drug crimes was greatly diminished.</p>
<p>The curtailment of states’ rights went further. Grants for new prisons contained the provision that receipt of the money was dependent on the states ensuring that prisoners served at least 85 percent of their sentences. These inmates, remember, had been convicted in state, not federal, courts so this was simply federal blackmail to curtail parole at the state level. The Clinton administration also pressed the states to try juvenile offenders as adults. Gore articulated the administration’s position: “When young people cross the line, they must be punished. When young people commit serious, violent crimes, they should be prosecuted like adults.” Nonviolent offenders were to be sent to boot camps. Not, it should be noted, his own kids, who evaded punishment for nonviolent infractions such as smoking pot and having an open alcohol container in the car.</p>
<p>The Clinton/Gore administration was particularly assiduous in its assaults on the Fourth Amendment, protecting citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures. In 1994, they successfully pressed for a bill providing all communications providers to make existing and future communication systems wiretap ready. They also pushed hard for the so-called Clipper Chip, an encryption device that makes it easy for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to snoop on private messages.</p>
<p>The high-water mark in the Clinton administration’s attack on the Bill of Rights came in 1996 with the Counter-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which among other horrors allowed the INS to deport immigrants without due process, and denied prisoners the right to appeal to the federal bench based on habeas corpus petitions. “When historians write the story of civil liberties in the twentieth century,” said Ira Glasser, head of the ACLU, “they will say that the Clinton administration adopted an agenda that has everything to do with weakening civil rights and nothing to do with combating terrorism.”</p>
<p>In May of 2000, Gore outlined his campaign posture on crime and drugs in another speech in Atlanta. The erstwhile dope-smoker from Tennessee evidently feared that the man who refused to discuss cocaine use in his early years, George W. Bush, had the edge on the crime issue. Gore proclaimed he wanted to swaddle communities in “a blanket of blue”. He swore that the minute he settled in the Oval Office, President Gore would call for 50,000 more cops (i.e., more half-trained recruits like the ones who shot Amadou Diallo forty-one times in the Bronx) and would allow off-duty cops to carry concealed weapons (which they almost all do anyway).</p>
<p>Gore promised prisoners what he called a simple deal: “Before you get out of jail you have to get clean. If you want to stay out, then you better stay clean. We have to stop that revolving door once and for all. First we have to test prisoners for drugs while they’re in jail”. Gore was so blithe in his disregard for elementary rights that he was unable to see a distinction between a prison sentence fully served and a further punitive add-on: “We have to insist on more prison time for those who don’t break the habit”. Even after prisoners are released the eye of the state would still follow them: “We should impose strict supervision on those who have just been released–and insist they obey the law and stay off drugs”.</p>
<p>Another feature of Al Gore’s prospective war on crime was the especially vigorous targeting of minority youth. “I will fight for a federal law that helps communities establish gang-free zones with curfews on specific gang members, a ban on gang-related clothing and the specific legal authority to break violent teen gangs once and for all”.</p>
<p>Both parties have eagerly conjoined in militarizing the police, extending police powers and carving away basic rights. Often the Democrats have been worse. It was Republican Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois who led the partially successful charge in 1999 against the seizure of assets in drug cases. It was Democrat Senator Charles Schumer of New York who played the role of factotum for the Justice Department in trying to head off Hyde and his coalition.</p>
<p>The rise of the Jackboot State has marched in lockstep with the insane and ineffective War on Drugs. This has been an entirely bi-partisan affair. Its consequences are etched into the fabric of our lives. Just think of drug testing, now a virtually mandatory condition of employment, even though it’s an outrageous violation of personal sovereignty, as well as being thoroughly unreliable. In an era in which America has been led by three self-confessed pot smokers–Clinton, Gore and Bush–the number of people held for drug crimes in federal prisons has increased by 64 percent.</p>
<p>No-knock raids are becoming more common as federal, state and local politicians and law enforcement agencies decide that the war on drugs justify dumping the Fourth Amendment. Even in states where search warrants require a knock on the door before entry, police routinely flout the requirement.</p>
<p>The Posse Comitatus Act forbidding military involvement in domestic law enforcement is rapidly becoming as dead as the Fourth Amendment. Because of drug war exceptions created in that act, every region of the United States now has a Joint Task Force staff in charge of coordinating military involvement in domestic law enforcement. The involvement has now expanded to include anti-terrorism investigations.</p>
<p>In many cases, street deployment of paramilitary units is funded by “community policing” grants from the federal government. The majority of police departments use their paramilitary units to serve “dynamic entry” search warrants. The SWAT Team in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, conducted a large-scale crack raid of an entire block in a predominantly black neighborhood. The raid, termed Operation Redi-Rock, resulted in the detention and search of up to 100 people, all of whom were black. (Whites were allowed to leave the area.) No one was ever prosecuted for a crime. In Albany, New York, not long before the change-of-venue trial there of the four white cops who had killed Amadou Diallo in the Bronx, police in camouflage uniforms went on a ransacking spree in the black neighborhood of Arbor Hill, beating down doors house-to-house in search of a black suspect.</p>
<p>Where there is no social program, there’s always a violence program. For the Clinton/Gore administration welfare reform and expansion of the police state were not only means to trump the Republicans; they were also essential to economic policy. Intense competition for jobs at the lowest rungs would depress wages, pit poor and working-class people against each other and, where workfare recipients displace municipal workers, weaken labor unions. The spectre and reality of incarceration would have the traditional effect of suppressing the dangerous classes, at a time when the wage gap between the rich and the poor grew wider than at any time in recent history.</p>

<p>By readers’ request, this is a reposting of a translation of a Pakistani National TV interview with an eyewitness to the alleged SEAL Team Six attack that allegedly killed Osama bin Laden. I made the translation available two years ago in an article prior to the creation of this website.  </p>
<p>Before you believe “your” government’s lies about Syria, remember “your” government’s lies about Saddam Hussein’s “weapons of mass destruction.” Remember Washington’s lies about the Gulf of Tonkin that unleashed the Vietnam war. Remember the lies about Gaddafi and Libya. Remember  the lies about 9/11, the lies about the murders of JFK, Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King. Remember the Northwoods Project that the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted President John F. Kennedy to embrace. </p>
<p>The Northwoods project called for shooting down US airliners, shooting down people on the streets of Miami and Washington, D.C., and strafing Cuban refugee boats in order to blame Castro and build public support for regime change in Cuba. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods'  target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods</a></p>
<p>Sound familiar?  Sound like regime change in Iraq, Libya, Syria? </p>
<p>The top secret Operation Northwoods plot against Cuba and the American people was officially released and is available online, as are numerous histories of the proposal by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff to kill Americans in order to create support for invading Cuba. Keep this established fact in mind before you again repeat the gullible and reassuring statement: “our government wouldn’t kill its own people.”  </p>
<p>Try to find any of Washington’s agendas about which the government spoke truthfully. The US government is so enamored of its secret agendas that Washington never speaks truth.  Keep in mind that Washington’s 12 years of wars, which have doubled the US national debt and left the federal government without the means to help the rising number of Americans whose jobs have been given to foreigners and whose homes are foreclosed, have their origin in 9/11, the investigation of which was prevented by the White House. </p>
<p>After resisting for one year the pressure from 9/11 family members for an investigation, the White House created a political panel to listen to the government’s line and to write it down in the 9/11 Commission Report, a report promptly disavowed by both co-chairmen of the commission and the chief legal advisor, all of whom described the 9/11 commission as &#8220;set up to fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Obama regime has shown no interest in investigating how the most powerful national security state of all time, a Stasi police state that spies on the entire world, could be defeated by a few Saudi Arabians, who had no support from any government or any intelligence service, or why instead of a real investigation, the Bush White House chose an orchestrated cover-up.</p>
<p>The US government’s claim to have killed bin Laden has a zero probability of being true. According to Pakistani eye witnesses to the attack on the alleged Osama bin Laden compound in Pakistan, the Obama regime’s claim is simply more theater, more lies.</p>
<p>In this interview from Pakistani National TV you can learn about your government’s lies about killing Osama bin Laden.</p>

<p>In my article, “Creating Evidence Where There Is None,” <a href='http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2011/08/05/creating-evidence-where-there-is-none/'  target="_blank">http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2011/08/05/creating-evidence-where-there-is-none/</a>  about the alleged killing of Osama bin Laden by a commando team of US Seals in Abbottabad, Pakistan, I reported a Pakistani National TV interview with Muhammad Bashir, who lives next door to the alleged &#8221;compound&#8221; of Osama bin Laden. I described the story that Bashir gave of the &#8221;attack&#8221; and its enormous difference from the story told by the US government. In Bashir’s account, every member of the landing party and anyone brought from the house died when the helicopter exploded on lift-off. I wrote that a qualified person could easily provide a translation of the interview, but that no American print or TV news organization had reported or investigated the interview of Muhammad Bashir by Pakistani National TV.</p>
<p>An attorney with a British Master of Laws degree in international law and diplomacy, who was born in Pakistan, provided the translation below. He writes: &#8221;I have no problem with being identified as the translator, but would prefer to remain anonymous.&#8221;</p>
<p>The translator provides these definitions and clarifications:</p>
<p> &#8221;Gulley&#8221; is generally referred (in Urdu) to a sidewalk or pavement. Also for the space between two houses.</p>
<p>  &#8220;kanal&#8221; is a traditional unit of land area, so that one kanal equals exactly 605 square yards or 1/8 Acre; this is equivalent to about 505. 857 square meters.</p>
<p>   Muhammad Bashir refers to himself as &#8221;We&#8221;. This is common respectable language for the self; to use the plural term instead of singular. The English language equivalent would be the &#8221;Royal, We&#8221;.</p>
<p>   Urdu is the national language and lingua franca of Pakistan.<br />
The translator:</p>
<p>I have translated the entire text of the video. </p>
<p>I have tried my best to keep words in a chronological order, but in some cases this is not possible, as in translation words must be replaced in reverse order to make sense! However, I have had to put a few words in brackets to clarify meaning. If you want to ask about any section—please supply time stamp and I will supply a contextual text.  </p>
<p>Video Transcript:  </p>
<p>Welcome back!—Muhammad Bashir, Abotabad Area, Bilal Town resident, Looks like an ordinary person, but he is no ordinary person! Muhammad Bashir, lives in Abotabad&#8217;s, Bilal Town Opposite Bin Laden&#8217;s House. </p>
<p>Night of 2nd May Muhammad Bashir was on the roof of his house, whereupon, the entire OBL, American operation was seen with his own eyes.<br />
Last night, when our team was in Abotabad, Bilal Town, near OBL house, Muhammad Bashir approached me and said that:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sister, I want to tell you something that is a great burden on my heart and conscience&#8221;—Listen to what he said:  </p>
<p>00: 59 Muhammad Bashir: I. . today. . . would like to comment about todays Abotabad operation events, until now, what I am about to say, no person has said.</p>
<p>01: 08: Reporter: But, Muhammad Bashir sahib appeared frightened. While speaking to me, Muhammad Bashir sahib phoned his relative; leader, M. E. A. of Jamaat-e-islami, Abotabad, Abdul Razaq Abaasi on the phone.</p>
<p>01: 21: reporter: Tell me your name and where do you live?</p>
<p>Muhammad Bashir: —One minute, first I need to speak to him. . . I am going to give an interview, a complete interview. Shall I give a complete interview or half?<br />
Reporter: Complete!—complete!</p>
<p>Muhammad Bashir: I first need to phone him, I need to speak to him<br />
Reporter: I could of. . .</p>
<p>01: 39: Reporter: Muhammad Bashir sahib, on that night&#8217;s events of the American operation, that took place, he expressed such comments about circumstances that have never been expressed before, therefore, we checked his ID card, his place of residence and we can confirm that he definitely lives there and we also approached senior politicians and asked about him, after hearing his comments, we were amazed—now you watch what he said.</p>
<p>01: 57: Muhammad Bashir: The events that happened are thus; we were awake, we were not asleep.</p>
<p>02: 00: Muhammad Bashir: a Helicopter came, and circled and dropped some people there.</p>
<p>02: 07: Muhammad Bashir: in that house. . . where they are saying, Osama lives here; on that house&#8217;s roof, they dropped people, after that, the helicopter returned and went back.</p>
<p>02: 16: Reporter: How many people were they?</p>
<p>02: 18: Muhammad Bashir: They were ten, twelve people</p>
<p>02: 20: Muhammad Bashir: After that it left and for approximately 20 minutes, there behind us, on those mountains, it kept going around, the top of the mountains.</p>
<p>02: 27: After 20 minutes, it returned. When it returned, at that time there were TWO more helicopters arrived. One came from the West and one came from the North. When it approached for landing, after that. . .<br />
At this point; Video cut and resumed:</p>
<p>02: 41: Muhammad Bashir: that helicopter, there was an explosion within it and there was fire within it, immediately, we came out and arrived there. When we arrived, the helicopter was on fire, it was burning. After that, about twenty minutes later the Army arrived, the police arrived. They moved all of us back. . .</p>
<p>03: 04: Muhammad Bashir: . . . and all the people inside it, all of them. . . we think; if Osama was inside it, or inside this house—then who took him to the Americans?</p>
<p>03: 16: Muhammad Bashir: Because America. . . the helicopters that America is saying; IT carried out the operation. If America did this operation and it&#8217;s army came and it&#8217;s helicopter came, then that helicopter that came from the American&#8217;s, within that, all the people that came, those people with the explosion were finished, got destroyed!</p>
<p>03: 35: Muhammad Bashir: Within it, there was fire, those people, all of them died!</p>
<p>03: 39: and if Osama was there, they would have put him in the helicopter. Obviously, if the helicopter caught fire, Osama could have died there. If their own people were gone, (dead) so could have Osama. After that, the fallen helicopter was destroyed after this, how can Osama be, with them in America? this is a strange thing!<br />
Video cut &amp; resumes</p>
<p>03: 59: Muhammad Bashir: They are saying we killed Osama here. After that, they picked him up and took him away.</p>
<p>04: 04: Muhammad Bashir: PICKED HIM UP AND TOOK HIM AWAY—how did they do this? This, what we are thinking!</p>
<p>04: 07: Muhammad Bashir: The Americans&#8217; helicopter that came, that fell here and got destroyed!</p>
<p>04: 09: Reporter: There was only ONE helicopter?</p>
<p>04: 11: Muhammad Bashir: ONE helicopter landed down here, the second helicopter came from above and went towards Mansera.</p>
<p>It did not land. No second helicopter landed!</p>
<p>04: 20: Only ONE helicopter, that first dropped it&#8217;s passengers, the SAME returned to pick the people and there was an explosion within it.</p>
<p>04: 27: Reporter: People were inside it?</p>
<p>04: 29: Muhammad Bashir: People were inside it!</p>
<p>04: 30: Reporter: How do you know this?</p>
<p>04: 32: Muhammad Bashir: These people, we seen them all.</p>
<p>04: 34: Reporter: In the helicopter. . . you saw dead people?<br />
04: 36: Muhammad Bashir: We saw dead people!</p>
<p>04: 38: Reporter: How many people?</p>
<p>04:39: Muhammad Bashir: This, we could not count, within the compound there was fire.</p>
<p>04: 43: Muhammad Bashir: and we. . . the gate was open, we entered the gate, at that time the Army had not arrived.</p>
<p>04: 48: Muhammad Bashir: Police had not arrived. Some people from the agencies, were present, but they did not prevent anybody, they kept entering, every person was looking , now, nobody is saying, but everyone from the mohalla (neighbourhood) and all the people present from the mohalla arrived first. We saw the gate open, we entered inside, saw the burning helicopter, the people inside were dead. After that everything was lifted. Now, there is nothing there!</p>
<p>05: 16: Reporter: How many dead bodies did you see?</p>
<p>05: 18: Muhammad Bashir: Look, you cannot count, the dead bodies were in pieces everything else was broken pieces, some here, some there, some broken, some half, some like this.</p>
<p>05: 27: Reporter: Tell me fully—what happened?</p>
<p>06: 30: Reporter: Tell me the full events</p>
<p>05: 31: Muhammad Bashir: I told you, this is. .<br />
 .<br />
05: 32: Reporter: You did not. . . I cannot believe this, that&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>05: 36: Muhammad Bashir: Look, what I have said—that&#8217;s it!<br />
Video Cut!</p>
<p>05: 39: Reporter: When you saw the American craft, (Helicopter) what did you think, why they came here?</p>
<p>05: 42: Muhammad Bashir: We thought. . . this is it. . . why did they came? we thought why did they come? maybe. . we. . . did not expect them to do anything, we thought maybe our Army is arriving at some centre and the army people were sleeping, there was no explosions or events taking place, nothing was happening, everybody was sleeping, for 20 minutes or so. . .</p>
<p>06: 05: Reporter: The craft landed in front of your house, how did you feel about this?</p>
<p>06: 08: Muhammad Bashir: I thought. . just. . . understand. . . imagine. . we thought we&#8217;re dead!</p>
<p>Video cut:</p>
<p>06: 13: Reporter: But, how did the Americans return?</p>
<p>06: 16: Muhammad Bashir: This is what I am saying; their Craft came and the helicopter was destroyed, HOW, could they return?</p>
<p>06: 22: Reporter: Tell me this; you say, that you saw the dead bodies yourself. . . .</p>
<p>06: 25: Muhammad Bashir: one more thing, Madam, may I tell you; The people who were dropped from the craft, That walkway . . . that . . where our gates are. . . they banged them hard. . . and shouted. . . don&#8217;t come out. . . don&#8217;t do this, don&#8217;t do that, if you come out you will be shot. . we will do this, we will do that, all the people who were dropped, all of them spoke Pashtu<br />
(Afgahni Language)—Pakhtun!</p>
<p>06: 49: Reporter: Who were these people?</p>
<p>06: 49: Muhammad Bashir: This I do not know! Those who were dropped from the craft (helicopter), those people.</p>
<p>06: 54: Reporter: This, somebody else told me—that they spoke Pashtu.</p>
<p>06: 57: Muhammad Bashir: They WERE Pashtun! we do not know if they were working for the Americans, we do not know if they were working for Pakistan, we do not know if they were army people or civilian, what people, BUT they SPOKE PASHTU!</p>
<p>07: 07: Reporter: You said you heard they were asking for Osama?</p>
<p>07: 09: Muhammad Bashir: No, they didn&#8217;t ask me about Osama, they just said, do not come out, if you come out from your house, we will shoot you!</p>
<p>07: 16: Reporter: Were these Pakistani people?</p>
<p>Muhammad Bashir: who?</p>
<p>07: 18: Reporter: The ones who were saying that if you come out, we will shoot you.</p>
<p>07: 20: Muhammad Bashir: They said that in Pashtu!</p>
<p>07: 22: Reporter: so did they. . were you coming out. . . exactly where were you, where was you standing when this happened?</p>
<p>07: 26: Muhammad Bashir: Inside the house, on top of the roof, I was not in the house, just on top of the (flat)roof</p>
<p>07: 29: Reporter: from Above the roof these people in the helicopter. . .</p>
<p>07: 30: Muhammad Bashir: I was on the roof, lying down, on the roof,lying and watching this and what was happening</p>
<p>07: 37: Reporter: Fear, was you not afraid? did you not think to phone someone?</p>
<p>07: 40: Muhammad Bashir: From the house, They were calling me from downstairs, the children were calling me, come down, come down, and I told them stop making noise! go into your rooms, I am watching what is happening. Afterwards, I found out about this, that, Osama was killed here!</p>
<p>07: 53: Reporter: How did you get inside? (the compound)</p>
<p>Muhammad Bashir: where?</p>
<p>Reporter: when there was fire.</p>
<p>Muhammad Bashir: the gate was open, when there was fire, the gate was open.</p>
<p>08: 02: Reporter: The house gate was open?</p>
<p>08: 03: Muhammad Bashir: The outer gate, the big gate, was open.</p>
<p>08: 06: Reporter: You came from upstairs to downstairs?</p>
<p>08: 08: Muhammad Bashir: I came down, from my own house into the gulley, I didn&#8217;t go alone inside the other house, 200 other people went inside! Everybody saw it!<br />
08: 15: Reporter: All 200 saw the dead bodies?</p>
<p>08: 17: Muhammad Bashir: Everybody saw this. Whoever went inside they saw everything!</p>
<p>08: 20: Reporting: the events at that time that are in your mind, please express them.</p>
<p>08: 28: Muhammad Bashir: I have told you this and this, in my mind, this is what I have seen, when we were there, when we entered the gate, When the helicopter exploded, it scattered everywhere, one piece fell over there, one fell here, one here, a lot of pieces fell in the gulley outside, they reached up to the gulley and our house and also some pieces managed to reach onto my roof. so, the area of the open space there (in front of the house) is about four Kanal in size. It is a very large compound. You cannot see all of it from one location. Four Kanal is a big area, only in a small area you could possibly see everything. There I saw some people, in broken pieces, someone&#8217;s leg, someone&#8217;s arm, someone&#8217;s torso, someone&#8217;s head. Beside this, I did not see intensely, who are they, how are they, because I thought that one of our own craft had fallen and the people within it were our own people. Because they spoke Pashtu they could be pakistani.</p>
<p>09: 35: Muhammad Bashir: but language does not necessarily mean. . by speaking it. . . the American language could be spoken, the agents can speak all sorts of languages. It could be that it is the American army and they could speak Pashtu and the people would think that it is our own people.</p>
<p>09: 54: Reporter: Seeing the dead bodies—did you not feel fear?</p>
<p>09: 57: Muhammad Bashir: But we were thinking about ourselves at the time, but seeing the dead bodies who felt frightened?</p>
<p>10: 00: Reporter: When you went inside, what did you do after that, how did you come out?</p>
<p>10: 02: Muhammad Bashir: we came out, our Army reached there, when the army arrived, they moved all the people back. Move aside, move aside! So we moved aside. Then they closed the area down.</p>
<p>10: 13: Reporter: did Rais see this?</p>
<p>Muhammad Bashir: What?</p>
<p>Reporter: where was your cousin?</p>
<p>10: 18: Muhammad Bashir: My cousin was at that time in the house.</p>
<p>10: 20: Reporter: Did he go with you?</p>
<p>10: 21: Muhammad Bashir: He was with me, but I did not notice when he was picked up.<br />
10: 28: Reporter: Has he returned yet?</p>
<p>10: 29: Muhammad Bashir: Yes, he has returned. They picked him up and took him away.</p>
<p>10: 32: Reporter: What is he saying?</p>
<p>10: 34: Muhammad Bashir: I have not met him yet, he is at home they will not let him come out, we are not allowed to visit him, they will not let him come out. We have not met.</p>
<p>10: 40: Reporter: You was not able find out, but since when have you been allowed out.</p>
<p>10: 45: Muhammad Bashir: I did not go home, by going home. . .</p>
<p>Reporter: You have seen the fire you have seen the bodies how long did you stay there?</p>
<p>Muhammad Bashir: approximately, after five or six minutes, I left and came out. . five, six minute. . what happened . . . . the reason we left, was that after we entered, there was another small explosion, I do not know if the engine fail and there was another fire, it was a small explosion, after this explosion all the people ran out.</p>
<p>11: 06: Muhammad Bashir: when we went out, nobody let us go back in again.</p>
<p>11: 11: Reporter: Besides you, why is nobody else saying these things? why are you alone in this?</p>
<p>11: 16: Muhammad Bashir: Look, what we have seen, that is what we are saying and we are speaking for this reason that, we are sad that such humble and nice people of our town, that has never seen such events, no fighting, no arguments, no animosity, No murders, such nice people of ours in this town and they have been branded as terrorists.</p>
<p>11: 43: Reporter: Tell me; two helicopters came, lifted and took the rest of the people?</p>
<p>11: 46: Muhammad Bashir: No—they did not take the rest of the people, because they did not even land, One came from the West and it left towards the North, the one that came from the North, left towards the South. They did not land!</p>
<p>12: 00: Studio Reporter: these events that we showed you from Abotabad, there are many more things that we discovered about the compound where OBL was staying, there were vegetables planted there, what kind of vegetables, the person who grows the vegetables is the cousin of this person (Muhammad Bashir), whose interview we have shown. An extraordinary thing that he has said and he has sworn repeatedly on the veracity of his statement. this is from his own account and upon this account do view this. Yesterday we found out and it has been confirmed that there were two Ashfaq&#8217;s who lived there (in the compound): Mr Arshad and Mr Tariq who went shopping locally and used to buy international brands, the items they found in the house, dry dates, dried meat and things like this, this person who you saw in the interview in his house there was food from OBL&#8217;s house, he was given Kaabli Pillau (Rice) and such items were presented to him, There the view of local mosque people, what they think of OBL all these things we will present to you in an exclusive program an important newsbeat, todays time is finishing, do write to us at newsbeat@samaa. tv where you can get other information as well and you can join us at newsbeat with Fareeha Idrees thats my favourite bit, do write to us, the time is up now, By your permission to leave, take care of yourself, In Allah&#8217;s care.</p>
<p>13: 20: Reporter: I am now at standing in front of Abdullah Bin Zubair Mosque, this is the same mosque that is within walking distance from OBL&#8217;s house. Are you saying that if people found out that OBL was living here, would they be happy?</p>
<p>1st man: Possibly, people could be happy.</p>
<p>2nd man: He wasn&#8217;t living here, but he was a Muslim, he believed in Allah.</p>
<p>End of translation</p>
<p>Anyone fluent in Urdu who wishes to dispute the translation should do so.<br />
I asked the translator if he might contact the Pakistani news organization and inquire if the reporters had further investigated Bashir’s story. He replied that he could do so, but exactly 24 hours later &#8221;for some unknown reason&#8221; the news organization started to discredit Bashir by connecting &#8221;him to his cousin, who is accused of receiving foodstuffs from the household of OBL.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bashir’s cousin is the person who, according to the reporter (see 12:00 time line) had a vegetable garden inside the wall of the alleged bin Laden compound. Is it likely that with a hunted and dangerous person hiding within, locals would be permitted to have vegetable gardens inside the compound? The cousin’s vegetable garden obviously had to be redefined as &#8221;receiving foodstuffs from OBL.&#8221;</p>
<p>The translator offers his view on the 13:20 timeline:</p>
<p>&#8220;The final seconds of the video clip contain random people to generate and show some kind of sympathy with OBL in the district.  </p>
<p>&#8220;It would be very difficult to find people in Pakistan who sympathize with OBL or the Taliban. The only people who do sympathize are the poor illiterate people who do not know about the religion and can easily be convinced of a distorted version of Islam.<br />
“Therefore, the closing part of the video contains, out of context expressions:<br />
&#8220;1st man: Possibly, people could be happy. (Meaning it is possible that SOME people could be happy.)</p>
<p>2nd man: He wasn&#8217;t living here, but he was a Muslim, he believed in Allah. (Meaning; he claimed to be Muslim, so he must have believed in Allah.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore, it seems that although initially, the TV station was overjoyed with this interview, they changed their tune, twenty four hours later. (for some unknown reason.)&#8221;<br />
Readers can arrive at their own conclusions. It seems clear that under intense pressure and serious threats from the US government, the Pakistani government fell in line with the US government’s claim that a commando raid had killed bin Laden, and that the TV news organization got the message to get in line also.</p>
<p>It is likely that the many witnesses who observed the dead from the helicopter crash have been warned to keep quiet. However, a news organization, should one be so inclined, could certainly interview Bashir and the 200 others who saw the dead bodies. A good reporter, perhaps accompanied by trained psychologists, would be able to tell if people were lying out of fear and encourage some to speak anonymously.</p>
<p>I am confident that no news organization believes that it could confront such an important US national myth in this way. The killing of bin Laden satisfies the emotional need for revenge and justice. In the least, a news organization that challenged the government’s story would be cut off from all government sources and be denounced by politicians and a large percentage of the gullible US population as an anti-American terrorist-serving organization. They could even be arrested for giving aid and comfort to the enemy. In America today, truth-tellers are the last thing the government and much of the brainwashed public wants to here.</p>
<p>OBL’s death will remain one of those many &#8221;truths&#8221; that rest on nothing but the government’s word.<br />
				*		*		*<br />
<strong>UPDATE September 2013</strong>:  When is the last time the US government told the truth about anything? Despite an unbroken history of lies, the word of the US government still carries weight, especially with gullible Americans.</p>
<p>The link in my original article to the interview with Bashir has been taken down. This might be the original Pakistani National TV interview:<br />
<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NxGdProW-k'  target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NxGdProW-k</a></p>
<p>In another interview the BBC interviewed 50 residents of Abbottabad. The residents said that it was impossible that Osama bin Laden lived in their midst without their knowledge. The person who lives next door to the alleged “bin Laden compound” said that the resident shown in the American photo was not bin Laden, but his neighbor whom he knew well.  The Pakistanis say the killing of bin Laden is an American hoax.  <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWcDDSg9O7c'  target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWcDDSg9O7c</a>  </p>
<p>The Obama regime’s story of the murder of bin Laden is nonsensical. The fact that the regime would tell such a preposterous story indicates that Washington regards the American and international public as gullible morons, people lacking any ability to discern the truth of what they are officially told. </p>
<p>Who can believe that the “terror mastermind,” the head of what is said to be the most dangerous terrorist organization in the world, would be left alone, unguarded and unarmed, with only two women to protect him?  Who can believe that such a defenseless person with such essential information for Washington’s war on terror would simply be shot on sight by US Navy SEALs?  Why would Washington waste such an archive of information?  </p>
<p>Why would Washington forego the triumph of parading their captive before the world and confronting him in a courtroom with his crimes?  </p>
<p>Why would Washington dump the body secretly into the sea without even having photographic evidence to back the story?  Why would Washington tell such a preposterous story for which it can supply no evidence whatsoever?  </p>
<p>Why would Obama, faced with a reelection campaign, forego the patriotic publicity of a White House ceremony at which he pins medals on the victorious SEALs?  What politician would forego such an opportunity?</p>
<p>Do you really believe that the SEALs’ identity had to be protected in order to keep them safe from terrorists, or that Obama would let his reelection take a backseat to such a consideration?</p>
<p>No politician would handle the capture of Osama bin Laden in such a politically wasteful way.  Can you imagine a politician throwing away such marvelous opportunities for PR events?  Can you imagine an intelligence service destroying such a valuable source of information without interrogating Osama bin Laden?</p>
<p>Now consider this:  The Obama regime claims to have given bin Laden a proper Muslim burial at sea from an aircraft carrier, the Carl Vinson, named after a U.S. Representative from Georgia who served in the House for more than 50 years and is known as “the father of the two-ocean Navy.” The aircraft carrier has approximately 6,000 personnel.  From emails that sailors sent home to family and friends, none witnessed the sea burial of bin Laden.  </p>
<p>When the story of the emails got out, Washington quickly announced that bin Laden’s burial was conducted in secret and that no one but a few officers were involved.  </p>
<p>Think about this for a minute.  First of all, here again is a massive victory over the forces of terrorism being kept from sailors whose moral it would have raised.  Why keep a moral-boosting victory over terrorist evil from the crew of a deployed warship?  What was achieved by the secrecy?</p>
<p>Why give up the photography of such an important American victory that could so well stimulate patriots’ worship of Obama?  It makes no sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>Second, do you really believe that an at-sea burial can be conducted on a ship with 6,000 personnel with watches being kept, with sailors on deck performing a variety of necessary functions, and no one saw?  I mean, really!  6,000 people on one ship, and no one saw?  Were they all locked in their bunks?</p>
<p>Now consider the fate of SEAL Team 6, whose members allegedly murdered Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad.  Shortly after the alleged hit on bin Laden, SEAL team 6 was wiped out in Afghanistan.  The Obama regime claims that a helicopter carrying the SEAL team was shot down by the Taliban.</p>
<p>Just as the Bush regime’s story of 9/11 ran into opposition from the 9/11 families, the Obama regime’s story of the SEALs’ demise ran into opposition from SEAL families who studied the documents that comprised the Obama regime’s account. I don’t remember if I wrote about the SEAL families’ challenge to the government’s story, but I did some interviews about the families’ disbelief. The interviews or some of them would be posted on my website, such as <a href='http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2013/07/28/obamas-seal-team-6-coverup-explosive-paul-craig-roberts-interview/'  target="_blank">http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2013/07/28/obamas-seal-team-6-coverup-explosive-paul-craig-roberts-interview/  </a></p>
<p>The SEAL team families noticed that normal deployment operational procedures were not followed, that the entire SEAL team was loaded on a 50-year old Vietnam war era helicopter and not dispersed as required on their normal modern attack helicopters, and that a variety of other procedures devised to protect such expensively trained special forces were not followed. SEAL team members, according to parents, had written home expressing concerns about their safety. One told his father he had made a will. According to parents, the SEALs themselves sensed that they were in danger from internal forces, not from the external enemy.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no proof.  The criminal Obama regime will not indict itself.  But, just as the Carl Vinson sailors did not witness any at-sea burial of Osama bin Laden, the members of the SEAL team were asking each other, ”who was on the mission that got bin Laden?”</p>
<p>As it turned out, none were. Fearful of the emails that would follow the SEAL team’s discovery that no one was on the mission, the team was eliminated.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, Hollywood made a movie of the heroic SEAL team’s exploit in murdering an unguarded, unarmed “Terror Mastermind.”  An alleged SEAL wrote a book describing the “victory” of eliminating, prior to interrogation, the source of all terrorist plots, leaving the Americans in the total dark. The movie and book are likely nothing but organized propaganda to support the government’s lie.</p>
<p>Considering the gullibility of Americans, little doubt that the movie and book were successful.  It plays to the emotions of uninformed and unaware Americans that they have won.  They are equally happy when their favorite football team defeats the rival. The happiest days experienced by a generation is when Auburn defeats Alabama or vice versa, or Georgia Tech defeats Georgia or vice versa.  Americans are addicted to winning, and they remember these victories forever.  Little else is important to them.  Obama told them that they had defeated Osama bin Laden, who had died ten years before of terminal illnesses prior to his staged murder in a propaganda event, and that is all that is important to Americans. They won. “We beat bin Laden!”  And Obama won. Despite his sell-out of his every constituency and his transparent lies, Obama won reelection.</p>
<p>Obama is an anomaly. He is a warmonger who won the Nobel Peace Prize.  </p>
<p>Keep in mind that prior to the Obama regime’s announcement that the indispensable, exceptional country had killed bin Laden, Obama’s standing was so low that the Democrats were discussing running a candidate against him for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
<p>By faking an American victory over the demonized bogyman, Obama<br />
dispensed with threats to his reelection.</p>

<p>Police Are More Dangerous To The Public Than Are Criminals</p>
<p>Paul Craig Roberts</p>
<p>The worse threat every American faces comes from his/her own government.</p>
<p>At the federal level the threat is a seventh war (Syria) in 12 years, leading on to the eighth and ninth (Iran and Lebanon) and then on to nuclear war with Russia and China.</p>
<p>The criminal psychopaths in Washington have squandered trillions of dollars on their wars, killing and dispossessing millions of Muslims while millions of American citizens have been dispossessed of their homes and careers.  Now the entire social safety net is on the chopping bloc so that Washington can finance more wars.</p>
<p>At the state and local level every American faces brutal, armed psychopaths known as the police. The “law and order” conservatives and the “compassionate” liberals stand silent while police psychopaths brutalize children and grandmothers, murder double amputees in wheel chairs, break into the wrong homes, murder the family dogs, and terrify the occupants, pointing their automatic assault weapons in the faces of small children.  </p>
<p>The American police perform no positive function. They pose a much larger threat to citizens than do the criminals who operate without a police badge.  Americans would be  safer if the police forces were abolished.  </p>
<p>The police have been militarized and largely federalized by the Pentagon and the gestapo Homeland Security. The role of the federal government in equipping state and local police with military weapons, including tanks, and training in their use has essentially removed the police from state and local control.  No matter how brutal any police officer, it is rare that any suffer more than a few months suspension, usually with full pay, while a report is concocted that clears them of any wrong doing.</p>
<p>In America today, police murder with impunity.  All the psychopaths have to say is, “I thought his wallet was a gun,” or “we had to taser the unconscious guy we found lying on the ground, because he wouldn’t obey our commands to get up.”</p>
<p>There are innumerable cases of 240 pound cop psychopaths beating a 115 pound woman black and blue.  Or handcuffing and carting off to jail 6 and 7 year old boys for having a dispute on the school playground.</p>
<p>Many Americans take solace in their erroneous belief that this only happens to minorities who they believe deserve it, but psychopaths use their unaccountable power against everyone. The American police are a brutal criminal gang free of civilian control.</p>
<p>Unaccountable power, which the police have, always attracts psychopaths.  You are lucky if you only get bullies, but mainly police forces attract people who enjoy hurting people and tyrannizing them.  To inflict harm on the public is why psychopaths join police forces.</p>
<p>Calling the police is a risky thing to do. Often it is the person who calls for help or some innocent person who ends up brutalized or murdered by the police.  For example, on September 15 CNN reported a case of a young man who wrecked his car and went to a nearby house for help. The woman, made paranoid by the “war on crime,” imagined that she was in danger and called police. When the police arrived, the young man ran up to them, and the police shot him dead. <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/15/justice/north-carolina-police-shooting/'  target="_blank">http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/15/justice/north-carolina-police-shooting/</a>  </p>
<p>People who say the solution is better police training are unaware of how the police are trained. Police are trained to perceive the public as the enemy and to use maximum force. I have watched local police forces train. Two or three dozen officers will simultaneously empty their high-capacity magazines at the same target, a minimum of 300 bullets fired at one target. The purpose is to completely destroy whatever is on the receiving end of police fire.</p>
<p>US prosecutors seem to be the equal to police in terms of the psychopaths in their ranks.  The United States, “the light unto the world,” not only has the highest percentage of its population in prison of every other country in the world, but also has the largest absolute number of people in prison. The US prison population is much larger in absolute numbers that the prison populations of China and India, countries with four times the US population.</p>
<p>Just try to find a prosecutor who gives a hoot about the innocence or guilt of the accused who is in his clutches.  All the prosecutor cares about is his conviction rate. The higher his conviction rate, the greater his success even if every person convicted is innocent. The higher his conviction rate, the more likely he can run for public office.</p>
<p>Many prosecutors, such as Rudy Giuliani, target well known people so that they can gain name recognition via the names of their victims. </p>
<p>The American justice (sic) system serves the political ambitions of prosecutors and the murderous lusts of police psychopaths.  It serves the profit motives of the privatized prisons who need high occupancy rates for their balance sheets.</p>
<p>But you can bet your life that the American justice (sic) system does not serve justice.</p>
<p>While writing this article, I googled “police brutality,” and google delivered 4,100,000 results.  If a person googles “police brutality videos,” he will discover that there are more videos than could be watched in a lifetime.  And these are only those acts of police brutality that are witnessed and caught on camera.  </p>
<p>It would take thousands of pages just to compile the information available.</p>
<p>The facts seem to support the case that police in the US commit more crimes and acts of violence against the public than do the criminals who do not wear badges. According to the FBI crime Statistics<a href='http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/summary'  target="_blank"> http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/summary</a>  in 2010 there were 1,246,248 violent crimes committed by people without police badges. Keep in mind that the definition of violent crime can be an expansive definition. For example, simply to push someone is considered assault.  If two people come to blows in an argument, both have committed assault.  However, even with this expansive definition of violent crimes, police assaults are both more numerous and more dangerous, as it is usually a half dozen overweight goon thugs beating and tasering one person.  </p>
<p>Reports of police brutality are commonplace, but hardly anything is ever done about them. For example, on September 10, AlterNet reported that Houston, Texas, police routinely beat and murder local citizens. <a href='http://www.alternet.org/investigations/cops-are-beating-unarmed-suspect-nearly-every-day-houston?akid=10911.81835.yRJa7d&amp;rd=1&amp;src=newsletter894783&amp;t=9&amp;paging=off'  target="_blank">http://www.alternet.org/investigations/cops-are-beating-unarmed-suspect-nearly-every-day-houston?akid=10911.81835.yRJa7d&amp;rd=1&amp;src=newsletter894783&amp;t=9&amp;paging=off</a>    </p>
<p>The threat posed to the public by police psychopaths is growing rapidly. Last July 19 the Wall Street Journal reported:  “Driven by martial rhetoric and the availability of military-style equipment&#8211;from bayonets and M-16 rifles to armored personnel carriers&#8211;American police forces have often adopted a mind-set previously reserved for the battlefield. The war on drugs and, more recently, post-9/11 antiterrorism efforts have created a new figure on the US scene: the warrior cop&#8211;armed to the teeth, ready to deal harshly with targeted wrongdoers, and a growing threat to familiar American liberties.”</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal, being an establishment newspaper, has to put it as nicely as possible.  The bald fact is that today’s cop in body armor with assault weapons, grenades, and tanks is not there to make arrests of suspected criminals.  He is there in anticipation of protests to beat down the public for exercising constitutional rights. </p>
<p>To suppress public protests is also the purpose of the Department of Homeland Security Police, a federal para-military police force that is a new development for the United States.  No one in their right mind could possibly think that the vast militarized police have been created because of “the terrorist threat.”  Terrorists are so rare that the FBI has to round up demented people and talk them into a plot so that the “terrorist threat” can be kept alive in the public’s mind.</p>
<p>The American public is too brainwashed to be able to defend itself.  Consider the factthat cops seldom face any consequence when they murder citizens. We never hear cops called “citizen killer.”  But if a citizen kills some overbearing cop bully, the media go ballistic:  “Cop killer, cop killer.”   The screaming doesn’t stop until the cop killer is executed. </p>
<p>As long as a brainwashed public continues to accept that cop lives are more precious than their own, citizens will continue to be brutalized and murdered by police psychopaths.</p>
<p>I can remember when the police were different.  If there was a fight, the police broke it up.  If it was a case of people coming to blows over a dispute, charges were not filed. If it was a clear case of assault, unless it was brutal or done with use of a weapon, the police usually left it up to the victim to file charges. </p>
<p>When I lived in England, the police walked their beats armed only with their billysticks. </p>
<p>When and why did it all go wrong?  Among the collection of probable causes are the growth or urban populations, the onslaught of heavy immigration on formerly stable and predictable neighborhoods, the war on drugs, and management consultants called in to improve efficiency who focused police on quantitative results, such as the number of arrests, and away from such traditional goals as keeping the peace and investigating reported crimes. </p>
<p>Each step of the way accountability was removed in order to more easily apprehend criminals and drug dealers.  The “war on terror” was another step, resulting in the militarization of the police. </p>
<p>The replacement of jury trials with plea bargains meant that police investigations ceased to be tested in court or even to support the plea, usually a fictitious crime reached by negotiation in order to obtain a guilty plea.  Police learned that all prosecutors needed was a charge and that little depended on police investigations.  Police work became sloppy. It was easier simply to pick up a suspect who had a record of having committed a similar crime.</p>
<p>As justice receded as the goal, the quality of people drawn into police work changed. Idealistic people found that their motivations were not compatible with the process, while bullies and psychopaths were attracted by largely unaccountable power.</p>
<p>Much of the blame can be attributed to “law and order” conservatives.  Years ago when New York liberals began to observe the growing high-handed behavior of police, they called for civilian police review boards. Conservatives, such as National Review’s William F. Buckley, went berserk, claiming that any oversight over the police would hamstring the police and cause crime to explode. </p>
<p>The conservatives could see no threat in the police, only in an effort to hold police accountable. As far as I can tell, this is still the mindset.</p>
<p>What we observed in the police response to the Boston Marathon bombing suggests that the situation is irretrievable.  One of the country’s largest cities and its suburbs&#8211;100 square miles&#8211;was tightly locked down with no one permitted to leave their homes, while 10,000 heavily armed police, essentially combat soldiers armed with tanks, forced their way into people’s homes, ordering them out at gunpoint. The excuse given for this unprecedented gestapo police action was a search for one wounded 19-year old kid. </p>
<p>That such a completely unnecessary and unconstitutional event could occur in Boston without the responsible officials being removed from office indicates that “the land of the free” no longer exists. The American population of the past, suspicious of government and jealous of its liberty, has been replaced by a brainwashed and fearful people, who are increasingly referred to as “the sheeple.”</p>

<p>Paul Craig Roberts</p>
<p>Putin’s article in the September 11 New York Times has the stuck pigs squealing. The squealing stuck pigs are just who you thought they would be&#8211;all those whose agendas and profits would be furthered by an attack on Syria by the obama Stasi regime.</p>
<p>Included among the squealing stuck pigs are Human Rights Watch bloggers who seem to be financed out of the CIA’s back pocket.</p>
<p>Does any institution remain that has not been corrupted by Washington’s money?</p>
<p>Notice that the reason Putin is being criticized is that he has blocked the obama regime from attacking Syria and slaughtering countless numbers of Syrians in the name of human rights. The stuck pigs are outraged that obama’s war has been blocked.  They were so much looking forward to the mass slaughter that they believe would advance their profits and agendas.</p>
<p>Most of Putin’s critics are too intellectually challenged to comprehend that Putin’s brilliant and humane article has left Putin the leader of the free world and defender of the rule of law and exposed obama for what he is&#8211;the leader of a rogue, lawless, unaccountable government committed to lies and war crimes.</p>
<p>Putin, being diplomatic, was very careful in his criticism of obama’s September 10 speech in which obama sought to justify Washington’s lawlessness in terms of “American exceptionalism.” Obama, attempting to lift his criminal regime by the bootstraps up into the moral heavens, claimed that United States government policy is “what makes America different. It’s what makes us exceptional.”</p>
<p>What obama told Americans is exactly what Hitler told the Germans.  The Russians, having borne more than anyone else the full weight of the German war machine, know how dangerous it is to encourage people to think of themselves as exceptional, unbound by law, the Geneva Conventions, the UN Security Council, and humane concerns for others. Putin reminded obama that “God created us equal.”</p>
<p>If Putin had wanted to give obama the full rebuke that obama deserves, Putin could have said:  “obama is correct that the policy of the US government is what makes the US exceptional. The US is the only country in the world that has attacked 8 countries in 12 years, murdering and dispossessing millions of Muslims all on the basis of lies.  This is not an exceptionalism of which to be proud.”</p>
<p>Putin is obviously more than a match for the immoral, low grade morons that Americans put into high office.  However, Putin should not underestimate the mendacity of his enemies in Washington. Putin warned that the militants that Washington is breeding in the Middle East are an issue of deep concern. When these militants return to their own countries, they spread destabilization, as when extremists used by the US in the overthrow of Libya moved on to Mali.  </p>
<p>The destabilization of other countries is precisely the main aim of Washington’s wars in the Middle East. Washington intends for radicalization of Muslims to spread strife into the Muslim populations of Russia and China.  Washington’s propaganda machine will then turn these terrorists into “freedom fighters against oppressive Russian and Chinese  governments,” and use Human Rights Watch and other organizations that Washington has penetrated and corrupted to denounce Russia and China for committing war crimes against freedom fighters.  No doubt, chemical weapons attacks will be orchestrated, just as they have been in Syria.</p>

<p>Guest Column by Vladimir V. Putin</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin is established as the leader of the free world and the defender of the rule of law.</p>
<p>Barack Obama is established as the leader of a lawless, rogue war criminal government that lies through its teeth and schemes to massacre millions of peoples.</p>
<p>This morning in the New York Times the President of Russia writes:</p>
<p>“It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States. Is it in America’s long-term interest? I doubt it. Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan ‘you’re either with us or against us.’”</p>
<p>“But force has proved ineffective and pointless. Afghanistan is reeling, and no one can say what will happen after international forces withdraw. Libya is divided into tribes and clans. In Iraq the civil war continues, with dozens killed each day. In the United States, many draw an analogy between Iraq and Syria, and ask why their government would want to repeat recent mistakes.”</p>
<p>“We must stop using the language of force and return to the path of civilized diplomatic and political settlement.”</p>
<p>“If we can avoid force against Syria, this will improve the atmosphere in international affairs and strengthen mutual trust. It will be our shared success and open the door to cooperation on other critical issues.”</p>
<p>“My working and personal relationship with President Obama is marked by growing trust. I appreciate this. I carefully studied his address to the nation on Tuesday. And I would rather disagree with a case he made on American exceptionalism, stating that the United States’ policy is ‘what makes America different. It’s what makes us exceptional.’ It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. There are big countries and small countries, rich and poor, those with long democratic traditions and those still finding their way to democracy. Their policies differ, too. We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord’s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.”</p>
<p>Read President Putin’s entire article here:  <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html?pagewanted=all&#038;_r=0  '  target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html?pagewanted=all&#038;_r=0  </a></p>
<p>Contrast President Putin’s civilized diplomacy and appeal to good will with the latest report of the obama regime’s policy of deception and murder by brute force: </p>
<p>“Behind the scenes, US meddling continues apace in Syria’s civil war, and the CIA has now begun delivering lethal weapons and combat vehicles to rebel factions in hope of turning the tide of the conflict in favor of more nominally pro-US factions. <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-begins-weapons-delivery-to-syrian-rebels/2013/09/11/9fcf2ed8-1b0c-11e3-a628-7e6dde8f889d_story.html'  target="_blank">http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-begins-weapons-delivery-to-syrian-rebels/2013/09/11/9fcf2ed8-1b0c-11e3-a628-7e6dde8f889d_story.html</a></p>
<p>“The US has been threatening the move for months, and has been engaged in intensive training of rebel fighters in neighboring Jordan. The fighters have reportedly begun to cross into Syria, with an eye on attacking the capital city of Damascus.”</p>
<p><a href='http://news.antiwar.com/2013/09/11/cia-begins-delivering-arms-to-syrian-rebels/print/'  target="_blank">http://news.antiwar.com/2013/09/11/cia-begins-delivering-arms-to-syrian-rebels/print/</a>  </p>
<p>Keep in mind that the most effective of the “rebel fighters” supported by Washington are not Syrians but imported al-Qaeda terrorists, the defeat of whom has been the excuse for Washington’s 12-year, $6 trillion dollar war.</p>

<p>The Chief Executive enters; the Press Conference<br />
begins:</p>
<p>First the President lies about the date the Appalachian<br />
Mountains rose<br />
 <br />
Then he lies about the population of Chicago, then<br />
about the weight of the adult eagle, next about the<br />
acreage of the Everglades<br />
 <br />
He lies about the number of fish taken every year in the<br />
Arctic, he has private information about which<br />
city is the capital of Wyoming, he lies about the<br />
birthplace of Attila the Hun<br />
 <br />
He lies about the composition of the amniotic fluid, he<br />
insists that Luther was never a German, and insists<br />
that only the Protestants sold indulgences,<br />
 <br />
That Pope Leo X wanted to reform the church, but the<br />
“liberal elements” prevented him,<br />
 <br />
That the Peasants’ War was fomented by Italians from<br />
the North.<br />
 <br />
And the Attorney General lies about the time the sun<br />
sets.<br />

<p>Five New Consensus Points Released September 11, 2013<br />
on SEPTEMBER 12, 2013<br />
The 22-member 9/11 Consensus Panel has conducted three rounds of review, during which the Panelists were blind to one another, to produce five new Consensus Points refuting the official evidence of 9/11:</p>
<p>Seismic evidence of large underground explosions beneath the Twin Towers<br />
Physical and testimonial evidence of explosions beneath the Twin Towers<br />
Molten metal running below the Twin Towers’ debris for weeks after 9/11<br />
The failure — after 7 years of effort — of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to produce a computer simulation of the collapse of World Trade Center 7 that matched the visual collapse<br />
A serious problem in the timeline of the famous “Let’s Roll” call from Flight 93, which was used as a call to war<br />
This brings the total number of Consensus Points to 37.</p>
<p>Too Many Years Of Lies<br />
   from Mossadeq to 9/11</p>
<p>Paul Craig Roberts</p>
<p>Washington has been at war for 12 years.  According to experts such as Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes, these wars have cost Americans approximately $6 trillion, enough to keep Social Security and Medicare sound for years.  All there is to show for 12 years of war is fat bank balances for the armament industries and a list of destroyed countries with millions of dead and dislocated people who never lifted a hand against the United States.</p>
<p>The cost paid by American troops and taxpayers is extreme. Secretary of Veteran Affairs Erik Shinseki reported in November 2009 that “more veterans have committed suicide since 2001 than we have lost on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan.”  Many thousands of our troops have suffered amputations and traumatic brain injuries. At the Marine Corps War College Jim Lacey calculated that the annual cost of the Afghan war was $1.5 billion for each al-Qaeda member in Afghanistan.  Many US and coalition troops paid with their lives for every one al-Qaeda member killed. On no basis has the war ever made sense.</p>
<p>Washington’s wars have destroyed the favorable image of the United States created over the decades of the cold war.  No longer the hope of mankind, the US today is viewed as a threat whose government cannot be trusted. </p>
<p>The wars that have left America’s reputation in tatters are the consequence of 9/11. The neoconservatives who advocate America’s hegemony over the world called for “a new Pearl Harbor” that would allow them to launch wars of conquest. Their plan for conquering the Middle East as their starting point was set out in the neoconservative  “Project for the New American Century.”  It was stated clearly by Commentary editor Norman Podhoretz and also by many neoconservatives.</p>
<p>The neocon argument boils down to a claim that history has chosen “democratic capitalism” and not Karl Marx as the future. To comply with history’s choice, the US must beef up its military and impose the American Way on the entire world.</p>
<p>In other words, as Claes Ryn wrote, the American neoconservatives are the “new Jacobins,” a reference to the French Revolution of 1789 that intended to overthrow aristocratic Europe and replace it with “Liberty, equality, fraternity,” but instead gave Europe a quarter century of war, death, and destruction.</p>
<p>Ideologies are dangerous, because they are immune to facts. Now that the United States is no longer governed by the US Constitution, but by a crazed ideology that has given rise to a domestic police state more complete than that of Communist East Germany and to a warfare state that attacks sovereign countries based on nothing but manufactured lies, we are left with the irony that Russia and China are viewed as constraints on Washington’s ability to inflict evil, death, and destruction on the world.</p>
<p>The two pariah states of the 20th century have become the hope of mankind in the 21st century!   </p>
<p>As Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick prove in their book, The Untold History of the United States, the American government has never deserved its white hat reputation. Washington has been very successful in dressing up its crimes in moralistic language and hiding them in secrecy.  It is only decades after events that the truth comes out.</p>
<p>For example, on August 19, 1953, the democratically elected government of Iran was overthrown by a coup instigated by the US government. Sixty years after the event declassified CIA documents detail how the secret CIA operation overthrew a democratic government and imposed Washington’s puppet on the people of Iran. </p>
<p>The declassified documents could not have spelled it out any clearer:  “The military coup that overthrew Mossadeq and his National Front cabinet was carried out under CIA direction as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government.”  <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/19/politics/cia-iran-1953-coup'  target="_blank">http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/19/politics/cia-iran-1953-coup </a> </p>
<p>In the 21st century Washington is attempting to repeat its 1953 feat of overthrowing the Iranian government, this time using the faux “green revolution” financed by Washington.<br />
When that fails, Washington will rely on military action.</p>
<p>If 60 years is the time that must pass before Washington’s crimes can be acknowledged, the US government will admit the truth about September 11, 2001 on September 11, 2061. In 2013, on this 12th anniversary of 9/11, we only have 48 years to go before Washington admits the truth. Alas, the members of the 9/11 truth movement will not still be alive to receive their vindication.</p>
<p>But just as it has been known for decades that Washington overthrew Mossadeq,<br />
we already know that the official story of 9/11 is hogwash.  </p>
<p>No evidence exists that supports the government’s 9/11 story.  The 9/11 Commission was a political gathering run by a neoconservative White House operative. The Commission members sat and listened to the government’s story and wrote it down. No investigation of any kind was made.  One member of the Commission resigned, saying that the fix was in. After the report was published, both co-chairmen of the Commission and the legal counsel wrote books disassociating themselves from the report. The 9/11 Commission was “set up to fail,” they wrote.</p>
<p>NIST’s account of the structural failure of the twin towers is a computer simulation based on assumptions chosen to produce the result. NIST refuses to release its make-believe explanation for expert scrutiny. The reason is obvious.  NIST’s explanation of the structural failure of the towers cannot survive scrutiny.</p>
<p>There are many 9/11 Truth organizations whose members are high-rise architects,<br />
structural engineers, physicists, chemists and nano-chemists, military and civilian airline pilots, firemen and first responders, former prominent government officials, and 9/11 families.  The evidence they have amassed overwhelms the feeble official account.</p>
<p>It has been proven conclusively that World Trade Center Building 7 fell at free fall which can only be achieved by controlled demolition that removes all resistance below to debris falling from above so that no time is lost in overcoming resistance from intact structures.  NIST has acknowledged this fact, but has not changed its story.</p>
<p>In other words, still in America today official denial takes precedence over science and<br />
known undisputed facts.</p>
<p>On this 12th anniversary of a false flag event, it is unnecessary for me to report the voluminous evidence that conclusively proves that the official story is a lie.  You can read it for yourself. It is available online. You can read what the architects and engineers have to say. You can read the scientists’ reports. You can hear from the first responders who were in the WTC towers. You can read the pilots who say that the maneuvers associated with the airliner that allegedly hit the Pentagon are beyond their skills and most certainly were not performed by inexperienced pilots.</p>
<p>You can read David Griffin’s many books. You can watch the film produced by Richard Gage and Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 truth. You can read the 9/11 Toronto Report, International Hearings on 9/11. <a href='http://www.amazon.com/9-11-Toronto-Report/dp/1478369205/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376960447&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Toronto+Report'  target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/9-11-Toronto-Report/dp/1478369205/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376960447&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Toronto+Report </a>  You can read this book: <a href='http://www.international.to/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9319:hijacking-americas-mind-on-911-counterfeiting-evidence&amp;catid=66:oped&amp;Itemid=151'  target="_blank">http://www.international.to/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9319:hijacking-americas-mind-on-911-counterfeiting-evidence&amp;catid=66:oped&amp;Itemid=151</a> </p>
<p>Actually, you do not need any of the expert evidence to know that the US government’s story is false. As I have previously pointed out, had a few young Saudi Arabians, the alleged 9/11 hijackers, been capable of outwitting, without support from any government and intelligence service, not only the CIA and FBI, but all sixteen US intelligence services, the intelligence services of Washington’s NATO allies and Israel’s Mossad, the National Security Council, NORAD, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Traffic Control, and defeat Airport Security four times in one hour on the same morning, the White House, Congress, and the media would have been demanding an investigation of how the National Security State could so totally fail. </p>
<p>Instead, the President of the United States and every government office fiercely resisted any investigation. It was only after a year of demands and rising pressure from the 9/11 families that the 9/11 Commission was created to bury the issue.</p>
<p>No one in government was held accountable for the astonishing failure. The national security state was defeated by a few rag tag Muslims with box cutters and a sick old man dying from renal failure while holed up in a cave in Afghanistan, and no heads rolled.</p>
<p>The total absence from the government for demands for an investigation of an event that is the greatest embarrassment to a “superpower” in world history is a complete give-away that 9/11was a false flag event. The government did not want any investigation, because the government’s cover story cannot stand investigation.</p>
<p>The government could rely on the mega-media corporations in whose hands the corrupt Clinton regime concentrated the US media. By supporting rather than investigating the government’s cover story, the media left the majority of Americans, who are sensitive to peer pressure, without any support for their doubts. Effectively, the American Ministry of Propaganda validated the government’s false story.</p>
<p>Common everyday experiences of Americans refute the government’s story.  Consider, for example, self-cleaning ovens.  How many American homes have them?  Thirty million?  More?  Do you have one?</p>
<p>Do you know what temperature self-cleaning ovens reach?  The self-cleaning cycle runs for several hours at 900 degrees Fahrenheit or 482 degrees Celsius.  Does your self-cleaning oven melt at 482 degrees Celsius.  No, it doesn’t.  Does the very thin, one-eighth inch steel soften and your oven collapse? No, it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Keep that in mind while you read this:  According to tests performed by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), only 2% of the WTC steel tested by NIST reached temperatures as high as 250 degrees Celsius, about half the temperature reached by your self-cleaning oven. Do you believe that such low temperatures on such small areas of the WTC towers caused the massive, thick, steel columns in the towers to soften and permit the collapse of the buildings?  If you do, please explain why your self-cleaning oven doesn’t weaken and collapse.</p>
<p>In Section E.5 of the Executive Summary in this NIST report  <a href='http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=101019'  target="_blank">http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=101019</a>  it says: “A method was developed using microscopic observations of paint cracking to determine whether steel members had experienced temperatures in excess of 250 degrees C. More than 170 areas were examined . . .  Only three locations had a positive result indicating that the steel and paint may have reached temperatures in excess of 250 degrees C.”  Analysis of steel “microstructures show no evidence of exposure to temperatures above 600 degrees C for any significant time.”</p>
<p>In section 3.6 of the NIST report<a href='http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=860495'  target="_blank"> http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=860495 </a>NIST states: “NIST believes that this collection of steel from the WTC towers is adequate for purposes of the investigation.”</p>
<p>How did these truths get out? My explanation is that the NIST scientists, resentful of the threat to their jobs and future employment opportunities and chaffing under the order to produce a false report, revealed the coerced deception by including information that their political masters did not understand. By stating unequivocally the actual temperatures, NIST’s scientists put the lie to the coerced report.</p>
<p>The melting point of steel is around 1,500 degrees C. or 2,600 degrees F.  Steel can lose strength at lower temperatures, but the NIST scientists reported that only a small part of the steel was even subjected to moderate temperatures less than those obtained by the self-cleaning oven in your home.</p>
<p>If you need to think about this a bit more, obtain a copy of The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes. Have a look at the streetcar in photo 108. The caption reads: “The Hiroshima fireball instantly raised surface temperatures within a mile of the hypocenter well above 1,000 degrees F.”  Is the streetcar a melted lump of steel?  No, it is structurally intact, although blackened with burnt paint.</p>
<p>Washington would have you believe that steel that survived intact the atomic bomb would melt from low temperature, short lived, isolated office fires. What do you think of a government that believes that you are that stupid?</p>
<p>Who would support a government that lies every time it opens its mouth?</p>
<p>The three WTC buildings that were destroyed were massive heat sinks.  I doubt that<br />
the limited, short-lived, low temperature fires in the buildings even warmed the massive steel structures to the touch. </p>
<p>Moreover, not a single steel column melted or deformed from softening. The columns<br />
were severed at specific lengths by extremely high temperature charges placed on the columns. </p>
<p>On this 12th anniversary of 9/11, ask yourself if you really want to believe that temperatures half those reached by your self-cleaning oven caused three massive steel structures to crumble into dust. </p>
<p>Then ask yourself why your government thinks you are so totally stupid as to believe such a fairy tale as your government has told you about 9/11.</p>

<p>Why Are Obama and Kerry So Desperate to Start a New War?</p>
<p>Paul Craig Roberts </p>
<p>What is the real agenda? </p>
<p>Why is the obama Regime so desperate to commit a war crime despite the warnings delivered to the White House Fool two days ago by the most important countries in the world at the G20 Summit?  </p>
<p>What powerful interest is pushing the White House Fool to act outside of law, outside the will of the American people, outside the warnings of the world community?</p>
<p>The obama Regime has admitted, as UK prime minister david cameron had to admit, that no one has any conclusive evidence that the Assad government in Syria used chemical weapons.  Nevertheless, obama has sent the despicable john kerry out to convince the public and Congress on the basis of videos that Assad used chemical weapons “against his own people.”  </p>
<p>What the videos show are dead and suffering people.  <em>The videos do not show who did it.  The obama Regime’s case is nonexistent. It rests on nothing that indicates responsibility.  The obama Regime’s case is nothing but an unsubstantiated allegation.</em></p>
<p><em>What kind of depraved person would take the world to war based on nothing whatsoever but an unsubstantiated allegation?</em></p>
<p>The world’s two worse liars, obama and kerry, say Assad did it, but they admit that they cannot prove it.  It is what they want to believe, because they want it to be true. The lie serves their undeclared agenda.  </p>
<p>If obama and kerry were to tell the public the real reasons they want to attack Syria, they would be removed from office. </p>
<p>The entire world is teetering on a war, the consequences of which are unknown, for no other reason than two people, devoid of all integrity who lack the intelligence  and humanity to be in high office, are determined to serve  a tiny collection of warmongers consisting of the crazed, murderous Israeli government and their Muslim-hating neoconservative agents, who comprise a fifth column inside the obama Regime.</p>
<p>The Russian government has given evidence to the UN that conclusively proves that the al-Nusra, al-Qaeda affiliated invaders are responsible for the attack. There is also conclusive proof that the “rebels” have chemical weapons. In addition, a highly regarded journalist has reported, using direct quotes and the names of al-Nusra fighters, that the chemical weapons were given to al-Nusra by Saudi Arabia without proper handling instructions, and that an accidental explosion occurred before al-Nusra could use the Saudi-supplied weapons to frame-up the Assad government.</p>
<p>However the deaths were caused, they are unfortunate, but no more so that the deaths that obama has caused in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, Pakistan, Yemen, Egypt, and Syria. The proven deaths for which obama is responsible are many times the unproven deaths that obama attributes without evidence to Assad.</p>
<p>The indisputable fact is that Syrian deaths occur only because Washington initiated the invasion of Syria by external forces similar to the ones that Washington used against Libya. However the deaths occurred, the deaths are the doings of the criminal obama Regime.  Without the criminal obama Regime seeking the overthrow of the Syrian government, there would be no deaths by chemical weapons or by any other means.  This was a war initiated by Washington, Israel, Israel’s neoconservative fifth column inside America and the White House, and the captive western media that is bought and paid for by the Israel Lobby.</p>
<p>Assad did not start the war. The Syrian government was attacked by outside forces sent in by Washington and Israel.</p>
<p>Assad has much higher public support in Syria than obama has in the US, or cameron has in the UK, or hollande has in France, or merkel has in Germany, or netanyahu has in Israel.  </p>
<p>The White House Fool keeps repeating his nonsensical statement, as if the Fool is a wound-up talking doll, that Assad’s unproven “use of chemical weapons is a threat to global security.”  </p>
<p>Dear reader, who besides the White House Fool is so unbelievably stupid as to believe that Syria is a threat to world security?  </p>
<p>If Syria is a “threat to world security,” like Iraq was a “threat to world security,” like Iran is alleged to be a “threat to world security,” what kind of superpower is the United States? How low does the IQ have to be, how mentally impaired does the public have to be to fall for these absurd hysterical allegations?</p>
<p>Let’s turn obama’s claim upon the Fool.  Why isn’t it a threat to global security for obama to attack Syria?  There is no authority for obama to attack Syria just because he wants to and just because he has demonized Assad with endless lies and just because obama is the total puppet of the crazed Israeli government and his neoconservative national security advisor, in effect an Israeli agent, and just because the Ministry of Propaganda, including NPR,  repeats every obama lie as if it were the truth.</p>
<p>Isn’t it a threat to international security when a superpower can, acting on a whim, demonize a leader and a country and unleash mass destruction, as the US has done seven times in the past twelve years,?  There are millions of innocent but demonized victims of the “indispensable, exceptional USA,” the “light unto the world.”</p>
<p>Forget about the US media, which is nothing but a propaganda ministry for the Israel Lobby. What the members of Congress and what the American people need to ask obama is why does the White House only represent the Israel Lobby?  </p>
<p>No one supports an attack on Syria but the Israel Lobby.</p>
<p>Why is obama going to add yet another war crime to Washington’s 12-year record?  Wasn’t it enough to destroy the lives and prospects of millions of people in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Pakistan, Yemen, and Egypt? Why kill and destroy the life prospects of yet more millions of people in Syria and other countries into which obama’s war could spread?</p>
<p>Maybe the answer is that obama, kerry, and the crazed netanyahu and his neoconservative fifth column are zombies.  </p>

<p><em>“The European race’s last three hundred years of evolutionary progress have all come down to nothing but four words: selfishness, slaughter, shamelessness and corruption.”<br />
    Yan Fu</em></p>
<p>It only took the rest of the world 300 years to catch on to the evil that masquerades as “western civilization,” or perhaps it only took the rise of new powers with the confidence to state the obvious. Anyone doubtful of America’s responsibility for the evil needs to read <em>The Untold History of the United States</em> by Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick.</p>
<p>The “New American Century” proclaimed by the neoconservatives came to an abrupt end on September 6 at the G20 meeting in Russia.  The leaders of most of the world’s peoples told Obama that they do not believe him and that it is a violation of international law if the US government attacks Syria without UN authorization.</p>
<p>Putin told the assembled world leaders that the chemical weapons attack was “a provocation on behalf of the armed insurgents in hope of the help from the outside, from the countries which supported them from day one.”  In other words, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Washington&#8211;the axis of evil.</p>
<p>China, India, South Africa, Brazil, Indonesia, and Argentina joined Putin in affirming that a leader who commits military aggression without the approval of the UN Security Council puts himself “outside of law.”  </p>
<p>In other words, if you defy the world, obama, you are a war criminal. </p>
<p>The entire world is waiting to see if the Israel Lobby can push obama into the role of war criminal.  Many are betting that Israel will prevail over the weak american president, a cipher devoid of all principle.  A couple of decades ago before the advent of the american sheeple, one of the last tough Americans, Admiral Tom Moorer, Chief of Naval Operations and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, publicly declared that “no US president can stand up to Israel.” America’s highest ranking military officer could not get an honest investigation of the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty.</p>
<p>We are yet to see an american president who can stand up to Israel. Or, for that matter, a Congress that can.  Or a media.</p>
<p>The obama regime tried to counter its smashing defeat at the G20 Summit by forcing its puppet states to sign a joint statement condemning Syria.  However the puppet states qualified their position by stating that they opposed military action and awaited the UN report. </p>
<p>Most of obama’s bought-and-paid-for “supporters” are impotent, powerless. For example obama counts the UK as a supporting country because of the personal support of the discredited UK prime minister, david cameron, despite the fact that cameron was repudiated by the British Parliament in a vote that prohibits British participation in another of Washington’s war crimes. So, although cameron cannot bring the British people and the British government with him, obama counts the UK as a supporter of obama’s attack on Syria. Clearly, this is a desperate count of “supporting countries.”</p>
<p>The Turkish puppet government, which has been shooting its peacefully demonstrating citizens down in the streets, with no protest from obama or the Israel Lobby, supports “holding Syria accountable,” but not itself, of course, or Washington.</p>
<p>The puppet states of Canada and Australia, powerless countries, neither of which carry one ounce of world influence, have lined up to do the bidding of their Washington master. The entire point of having the top government job in Canada and Australia is the payoff from Washington. </p>
<p>The obama cipher also claims the support of Japan and the Republic of Korea, another two countries devoid of all diplomatic influence and power of any kind.  Helpless Japan is on the verge of being destroyed by the Fukushima nuclear disaster, for which it has no solution. As the radiation leaks spread into the aquifer upon which Tokyo and surrounding areas rely, Japan is faced with the possibility of having to relocate 40 million people.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, implicated in the transfer to al-Nusra rebels of the chemical weapons used in the attack, supports Washington, knowing that otherwise its tyranny is toast. Even the neoconservatives headed by obama’s shrill National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, want to overthrow the Saudis.</p>
<p>Obama claims also to have support from France and Germany. However both Hollande and Merkel have stated clearly that a diplomatic solution, not war, is their first choice and that the outcome rests on the UN.</p>
<p>As for Italy and Spain’s support, both governments are hoping to be rewarded with the Federal Reserve printing enough dollars to bail out their indebted economies so that both governments are not overthrown in the streets for their acquiescence to the looting of their countries by international banksters. Like so many Western governments, those of Italy and Spain, and, of course, Greece, support the international banksters, not their own citizens. </p>
<p>The president of the European Commission has declared that the European Union, the central overlord over Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, does not support a military solution to the Syrian Crisis. “The European Union is certain that the efforts should be aimed at a political settlement,” Jose Manuel Barroso told reporters at the G20 meeting. The EU has the power to issue arrest warrants for the heads of EU governments that participate in war crimes. </p>
<p>What this reveals is that the support behind the liar obama is feeble and limited. The ability of the Western countries to dominate international politics came to an end at the G20 meeting. The moral authority of the West is completely gone, shattered and eroded by countless lies and shameless acts of aggression based on nothing but lies and self-interests. Nothing remains of the West’s “moral authority,” which was never anything but a cover for self-interest, murder, and genocide.</p>
<p>The West has been destroyed by its own governments, who have told too many self-serving lies, and by its capitalist corporations, who offshored the West’s jobs and technology to China, India, Indonesia, and Brazil, depriving the Western governments of a tax base and the support of its citizens. </p>
<p>It is difficult to know whether citizens in the West hate their corrupt governments any less than do Muslims, whose lives and countries have been devastated by Western aggression, or than do citizens of third world countries who have been impoverished by being looted by predatory First World financial organizations.</p>
<p>The idiot Western governments have pissed away their clout. There is no prospect whatsoever of the neoconservative fantasy of US hegemony being exercised over Russia, China, India, Brazil, South Africa, South America, Iran.  These countries can establish their own system of international payments and finance and leave the dollar standard whenever they wish. One wonders why they wait. The US dollar is being printed in unbelievable quantities and is no longer qualified to be the world reserve currency. The US dollar is on the verge of total worthlessness.</p>
<p>The G20 Summit made it clear that the world is no longer willing to go along with the West’s lies and murderous ways. The world has caught on to the West.  Every country now understands that the bailouts offered by the West are merely mechanisms for looting the bailed-out countries and impoverishing the people. </p>
<p>In the 21st century Washington has treated its own citizens the way it treats citizens of third world countries. Untold trillions of dollars have been lavished on a handful of banks, while the banks threw millions of Americans out of their homes and seized any remaining assets of the broken families.</p>
<p>US corporations had their taxes cut to practically nothing, with few paying any taxes at all, while the corporations gave the jobs and careers of millions of Americans to the Chinese and Indians. With those jobs went US GDP, tax base, and economic power, leaving Americans with massive budget deficits, a debased currency, and bankrupt cities, such as Detroit, which once was the manufacturing powerhouse of the world.</p>
<p>How long before Washington shoots down its own homeless, hungry, and protesting citizens in the streets?</p>
<p>Washington represents Israel and a handful of powerful organized private interests. Washington represents no one else. Washington is a plague upon the American people and a plague upon the world.</p>

<p>I am not doing a payroll employment report this month.  It is the same old thing.

<p>The decline in the rate of unemployment is not a result of more jobs.  Actually fewer people are employed. The unemployment rate fell because the labor force shrank again as hundreds of thousands more Americans gave up looking for a job and, thus, are no longer counted as unemployed members of the labor force.</p>
<p>If you want to read a bit more, here is Dave Kranzler’s report:  <a href='http://truthingold.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-non-farm-payroll-report-bls.html  '  target="_blank">http://truthingold.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-non-farm-payroll-report-bls.html  </a></p>
<p>Dave might be a bit hard on the BLS statisticians. The considerable independence that civil service professionals formerly had was destroyed when the Clinton regime encouraged and coerced early retirements in order to make room for women and minorities. The civil service&#8217;s professionalism and institutional memory was damaged by clearing out many of the people who represented both. The Bush-Cheney regime took advantage of the weakened position of the civil service and dispensed with fact altogether in order to aid the corporate takeover of the environmental regulatory agencies and to coerce the kind of false reports that Secretary of State Colin Powell was sent to deliver at the UN.</p>

<p>Paul Craig Roberts</p>
<p>Does the American public have the strength of character to face the fact that the US government stands before the entire world revealed as a collection of war criminals who lie every time that they open their mouth?  Will  Congress and the American public buy the White House lie that they must support war criminals and liars or “America will lose face”?</p>
<p>The obama regime’s lies are so transparent and blatant that the cautious, diplomatic President Putin of Russia lost his patience and stated the fact that we all already know: John Kerry is a liar.  Putin said:  &#8220;This was very unpleasant and surprising for me. We talk to them [the Americans], and we assume they are decent people, but he [Kerry] is lying and he knows that he is lying. This is sad.&#8221;<br />
<a href='http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article36117.htm'  target="_blank">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article36117.htm</a>  </p>
<p>When Secretary of State Colin Powell was sent by the criminal bush regime to lie to the UN, Powell and his chief of staff claim that Powell did not know he was lying. It did not occur to the Secretary of State that the White House would send him to the UN to start a war that killed, maimed, and dispossessed millions of Iraqis on the basis of total lies. </p>
<p>The despicable John Kerry knows that he is lying.  Here is the American Secretary of State, and obama, the puppet president, knowingly lying to the world. There is not a shred of integrity in the US government. No respect for truth, justice, morality or human life.  Here are two people so evil that they want to repeat in Syria what the bush war criminals did in Iraq.</p>
<p>How can the American people and their representatives in Congress tolerate these extraordinary criminals?  Why are not obama and John Kerry impeached? The obama regime has every quality of Nazi Germany and Stasi Communist Germany, only that the obama regime is worse. The obama regime spies on the entire world and lies about it. The obama regime is fully engaged in killing people in seven countries, a murderous rampage that not even Hitler attempted.</p>
<p>Whether the criminal obama regime can purchase the collaboration of Congress and the European puppet states in a transparent war crime will soon be decided. The decision will determine the fate of the world.</p>
<p>As for facts, the report released to the UN by the Russian government concludes that the weapons used in chemical attacks in Syria are similar to the weapons in the hands of al-Nusra and are different from the weapons known to be possessed by Syria.<br />
<a href='http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article36116.htm'  target="_blank">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article36116.htm</a>  </p>
<p>The obama regime has released no evidence to the UN. This is because the criminal regime has no evidence, only made up fairy tales.</p>
<p>If the obama regime had any evidence, the evidence would have been released to British Prime Minister david cameron to enable him to carry the vote of Parliament. In the absence of evidence, cameron had to admit to Parliament that he had no evidence, only a belief that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons. Parliament told Washington’s puppet that the British people were not going to war on the basis of the Prime Minister’s unsubstantiated belief. </p>
<p>Are the American people and the rest of the world just going to stand there, sucking their thumbs, while a new Nazi State rises in Washington?  </p>
<p>Congress must vote down the war and make it clear to obama that if he defies<br />
the constitutional power of Congress he will be impeached.  </p>
<p>If the US Congress is too corrupt or incompetent to do its duty, the rest of the world must join the UN General Secretary and the President of Russia and declare that unilateral military aggression by the US government is a war crime, and that the war criminal US government will be isolated in the international community. Any of its members caught traveling abroad will be arrested and turned over to the Hague for trial.</p>

<p>Paul Craig Roberts</p>
<p>Many are asking what can be done to stop the pending US attack on Syria.</p>
<p>Two things can be done.</p>
<p>One is for the US Congress to realize that it does not save America’s face for Congress<br />
to endorse a policy that has been rejected by the rest of the world, including Washington’s closest ally, Great Britain.  For Congress to endorse what the UN Secretary General and the President of Russia have made unequivocally clear would be a war crime under international law harms, not rescues, America’s reputation.  Doing the wrong thing to save face does not succeed.</p>
<p>In the event that Congress fails to understand the real stakes and votes to support a criminal action, the second thing that can be done to stop the attack is for most other countries in the world&#8211;China, India, Japan, Brazil, Australia, Canada, Iran, South Africa, the European and South American countries&#8211;to add their clear unequivocal statements to those of the UN General Secretary and President Putin that an American attack on Syria that is not authorized by the UN Security Council is a war crime.  Expression by the governments of the world of this truthful statement would make it clear to Washington that it is isolated from the world community.  For Obama to proceed in an act of aggression in the face of united opposition would destroy all influence of the US government and make it impossible for any officials of the Obama regime to travel abroad or to conduct business with other governments.  What government would conduct business with a war criminal government?  It is up to the governments of the world to make it clear to Washington that the US government is not above the law and will be held accountable.</p>
<p>Note the reports from congressional offices of the total lack of any support for Obama&#8217;s<br />
attack on Syria. The entire world is now watching the obama regime demonstrate its total<br />
disregard for the will of the people. The obama regime is showing that American democracy<br />
is a hoax. <a href='http://www.wnd.com/2013/09/calls-to-congress-244-to-1-against-syria-war/'  target="_blank">http://www.wnd.com/2013/09/calls-to-congress-244-to-1-against-syria-war/ </a></p>

<p>Paul Craig Roberts</p>
<p>As I observed in previous columns, obama was pushed out onto the end of the limb by Israel and the neoconservatives. The UN, NATO, the British Parliament, and the rest of the world left the White House Fool there, out on the limb where Israel put him, to make war on Syria all alone.</p>
<p>This proved to be beyond the Fool’s ability, but instead of crawling back off the limb and finding an excuse to get down, obama decided to buy the Congress and to tell more lies.  </p>
<p>The White House and its presstitute media are telling Congress that it is too humiliating for the President of “the world’s only superpower” to have to crawl back along the limb and get down just because he told a lie.  Congress must ”save face” for  the liar who is “America’s first black president,” or the prestige and credibility of the US will be lost.  </p>
<p>What this really means, of course, is that the credibility of the Israel Lobby and the neoconservatives will be lost unless America again commits a war crime and destroys the life and prospects of many more people in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Heaven forbid that Washington lose prestige!  So money, lots of it, is speaking in Washington and in European capitals. We know that the despicable Cameron will do all in his power to prostitute the British government for Washington. </p>
<p>What has the “socialist” Hollande been promised that makes him so willing to demonstrate that France is obama’s whore? </p>
<p>What larger share of NATO’s military budget is Washington promising to underwrite in exchange for NATO’s support for another American war crime? </p>
<p>Will bags of money enable Washington to gather support for its latest crime against humanity? </p>
<p>But first Congress has to be brought around.</p>
<p>Congress will be pressured “to show a common front” with the White House in order to maintain America’s credibility. Members of the House and Senate will be told that now that America has been abandoned by its allies, Congress cannot leave the President of the United States hanging out to dry.  Congress must rush to the rescue of America’s prestige or Washington will lose its clout and Congress will lose its campaign contributions from the Israel Lobby and the military/security complex.  </p>
<p>This argument can even be effective with the strongest opponents to the attack on Syria.  Americans have a long tradition of jingoism, and the prospect of lost prestige rankles. But before Congress is pushed into wrapping itself in the flag and giving its OK to another war crime, Congress needs to consider whether endorsing obama’s attack on Syria helps US prestige or hurts it. </p>
<p>It is clear that the American people overwhelming oppose an attack on Syria. Whether Americans have caught on over the years to Washington’s endless war lies or whether they simply see no point to the wars and no gain to America from 12 years of costly war, I cannot say. At a time when a large percentage of Americans are having difficulty paying their mortgages, car payments, and putting food on the table, Washington’s wars seem an expensive luxury. </p>
<p>It is not only the civilian populations of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and Syria who have suffered.  Tens of thousands of America’s young have either been killed, maimed for life, or are suffering permanent post-traumatic stress. Washington’s wars have caused thousands of divorces, alcoholism, drug addiction, and homelessness for veterans who were deceived and had their humanity abused by the criminals that rule in Washington.</p>
<p>For Congress, allegedly the representatives of the American people, not the backstop for the executive branch’s undeclared agenda, to ignore the people’s will and to endorse a war that the American people do not support would be another decisive blow against democracy.  If Congress endorses obama’s war, it will prove that American democracy is a hoax. </p>
<p>If the White House were to succeed in using Congress’ OK to a military attack on Syria to convince the British Parliament and NATO to go along, despite the strong opposition of the British and European peoples, Western Democracy would everywhere be discredited. Where is the democracy when a few elites at the top can do whatever they want, commit any crime, despite the majority opposition of citizens?</p>
<p>If Congress endorses obama’s transparent lies, American democracy will never recover. If Congress makes itself the handmaiden of the executive branch, Congress will never again have an independent voice. Congress might as well close down.  It will have rendered itself superfluous and powerless.</p>
<p>If European governments endorse obama’s lies, it means the end of the West’s democratic prestige and will strip away the cloak behind which the West has hidden its  crimes against humanity. The voice of the West will never again carry any moral authority.</p>
<p>The loss of Western credibility is a huge price to pay in order to rescue a discredited president whom no one believes, not even his supporters. Essentially obama is a cipher whose term of office is complete. The obama regime epitomizes the degeneration of the American state.</p>
<p>Instead of voting on whether to allow obama to attack Syria, Congress should be voting to impeach obama and kerry. Their blatant lies, dictatorial claims, and arrogant inhumanity are powerful arguments for removing them from office. </p>
<p>The lies told by the obama regime are so transparent that it makes one wonder just how stupid the regime thinks the American people are. Little doubt the white house is relying on its Ministry of Propaganda, a.k.a., the presstitute media, to undermine Americans’ confidence in their common sense and to make them accept the latest fiction.  The tactic is to use the peer pressure of the prostitute media to silence Americans’ conscience.</p>
<p>Media insouciance is everywhere. Yesterday NPR calmly reported the lies about Assad that the obama regime has concocted to cover another act of naked aggression. In the same breath, NPR voiced “the world’s outrage” over the rape and murder of one woman in India.  </p>
<p>I, of course, do not agree with the raping and killing of anyone, but just imagine the raping and killing that will occur when obama unleashes the dogs of war on Syria.</p>
<p>NPR is no longer an alternative voice. Yesterday NPR was beating the drums for war. NPR provided a forum for the head of one of the main neoconservative lobbies for war,  and in the next hour had Democratic and Republican House and Senate leaders repeating all of obama and kerry’s lies about how America’s prestige cannot tolerate allowing Assad to use “chemical weapons against his own people.”  No one listening to NPR heard the voice of those demanding peace and truth. NPR was too busy lying for Obama to care about truth and certainly gave truth no voice on the program.</p>
<p>The presstitute media and the House and Senate “leaders” who report to the military/security complex and to the Israel Lobby keep talking about Assad’s “own people,”  but Assad’s own people support him.  Polls of Syrians show that Assad has more support from the Syrian people than every head of every Western country has from their citizens. Cameron’s, Hollande’s, Merkel’s and obama’s poll numbers are dismal compared to the Syrian peoples’ support for Assad.  <a href='http://www.worldtribune.com/2013/05/31/nato-data-assad-winning-the-war-for-syrians-hearts-and-minds/'  target="_blank">http://www.worldtribune.com/2013/05/31/nato-data-assad-winning-the-war-for-syrians-hearts-and-minds/  </a></p>
<p>Just as there was no evidence that Saddam Hussein had “weapons of mass destruction,” but the facts did not stop the Bush regime from telling its lies that resulted in massive deaths and destruction of Iraqis, deaths and destruction that continue as I write, Assad has not used chemical weapons “against his own people.”  All of the evidence points to a false flag event that obama could seize upon to launch America’s 7th war in 12 years. </p>
<p>Moreover, al-Nusra fighters are not Assad’s “own people.” The al-Nusra front are Islamist extremists recruited from outside Syria and sent in by Washington and Saudi Arabia to overthrow an elected Syrian government, just as Washington used the Egyptian military to overthrow the first elected Egyptian government in history and to shoot down in the streets hundreds of Egyptians who were protesting the military’s overthrow of the government that they had elected. </p>
<p>Whether or not Assad used chemical weapons against Washington-supported al-Nusra jihadists, and US Intelligence says that there is “no conclusive evidence,” it is nevertheless a war crime for Washington to attack a country that has not attacked, or threatened to attack, the US. Under the Nuremberg standard established by the United States, naked aggression is a war crime regardless of the character of the country attacked or the weapons it uses against forces that attack it.</p>
<p>If Washington succeeds in enabling the al-Nusra terrorists to overthrow the secular Syrian government, how will Washington get Syria away from al-Nusra? In Iraq the death and destruction continues today at the same pace as under the attempted US military occupation.  The criminal Bush regime did not bring “freedom and democracy” to Iraq. The Bush regime brought death and destruction that continues long after Washington’s exit. In Iraq today, as many people are blown apart and murdered as during the height of Bush’s war of aggression.</p>
<p>The chaos in which Washington left Iraq is a far cry from “freedom and democracy.” The obama war criminal did the same to Libya. In Afghanistan Washington added 12 years of war on top of the 10 years of war that Afghans fought with the Red Army.  The purpose of Washington’s war in Afghanistan has never been stated. No one knows what the war is about or why it continues.</p>
<p>According to the Bush regime, Afghanistan was attacked because the Taliban would not hand over Osama bin Laden without proof that he was responsible for 911. So why does the war continue 12 years after bin Laden died of renal failure and other diseases in December 2001 and then died again in May, 2011, two years and four months ago when obama claims to have had him killed by Navy SEALs, whose unit was mysteriously wiped out shortly thereafter in Afghanistan.  If the purpose of the Afghan war was to get bin Laden, why does the war continue when the man has twice died?</p>
<p>The lies being told by obama and kerry are so transparent that it makes one wonder if their strategy is to make such a poor case for war that the control Israel and the neocons have over US foreign policy will be broken.  What else is one to make of such absurd statements as john kerry’s claim that “this is our Munich moment!”  There is no comparison between Assad’s defensive effort to prevent the overthrow of the Syrian government by foreign jihadists supported by Washington and Hitler’s aggressive stance toward Czechoslovakia. </p>
<p>The Syrian government has initiated no war and has threatened no one.</p>
<p>America as my generation knew it no longer exists. Criminals have taken over and now rule.  Financial policy is in the hands of a small handful of banksters who control the US Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the financial regulatory agencies and who run the world for their own greed and profit. Foreign policy is the preserve of the Israel Lobby and the neoconservatives, every one of which is tightly tied to Israel.  Americans have no voice, and no representation. Whatever America is, the government is not influenced by the voices of the American people.</p>
<p>Whatever America is, it most certainly is not a democracy in which government is accountable to the people. </p>
<p>America is a country where a tiny elite has all power and does as it wishes.</p>
<p>If Congress rallies to obama’s war, Congress will have pushed the world closer to nuclear war. Russia and China see that the UN is powerless to prevent aggression and that Washington’s  aggression is aimed at them. As Russia and China build their nuclear forces, they will draw a starker line at Iran. Iran is Russia’s underbelly, and Iran is 20 percent of China’s oil supply. </p>
<p>From what I have been able to discern, both the Russian and Chinese governments have lost all confidence in Washington.  Neither government believes any of Washington’s lies and both countries are aware of Washington’s attempt to isolate them diplomatically and to surround them with military bases. Both countries know that they can expect the same demonization from the presstitute western media as Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, and Assad have received. They understand that western demonization is the prelude to destabilization and to military attack. </p>
<p>With the hubris, arrogance, and insanity of Washington an established fact, Russia and China perceive an enemy that intends their destruction.  As neither country is going to accept their demise, Congress’ acquiescence to obama’s lies in order to save “america’s prestige” sets the stage for nuclear war.</p>
<p>However, if Congress refuses to be committed to a war crime based on a lie, rejects obama’s bribes and intimidation, and vetoes the war criminal’s attack on Syria, it means,  the end of the influence of the Israeli Lobby, the bloodthirsty neoconservatives, and war mongers John McCain and Lindsay Graham.</p>
<p>Without Washington’s neoconservative belligerence, the governments of the world might, despite powerful and selfish private interests, be able to come together to sustain life on earth by protecting an increasingly vulnerable ecology from the predations of private capitalism. </p>
<p>If Congress fails to restrain the war that obama seeks, the world doesn’t have long to exist before the life-destroying bombs drop.  </p>

<p>Paul Craig Roberts</p>
<p>While still claiming dictatorial powers to start a war on his own authority, Obama put his unilateral attack on Syria on hold when he received a letter from more than 160 members of the House of Representatives reminding him that to take the country to war without congressional approval is an impeachable offense and when he saw that no country that could serve as cover for a war crime, not even the puppet British government and the NATO puppet states, would support America’s announced military aggression against Syria. </p>
<p>Obama got away with attacking Libya without an OK from Congress, because he used Washington’s NATO puppets and not US military forces.  That ploy let Obama claim that the US was not directly involved.</p>
<p>Now that the lack of cover and the challenge from Congress has caused the would-be tyrant Obama to put on hold his attack on Syria, what can we expect?</p>
<p>If Obama were intelligent, and clearly anyone who would appoint Susan Rice as his national security adviser is not intelligent, he would simply let the attack on Syria fade into the background and die as Congress returns on September 9 to face the insoluble problems of the budget deficit and debt ceiling.  </p>
<p>A competent administration would realize that a government that is unable to pay its bills without heavy use of the printing press is in far too much trouble to be worrying about what is going on in Syria.  No competent administration would risk a military strike that could result in a Middle East conflagration and a rise in oil prices, thus worsening the economic situation that Washington faces.</p>
<p>But Obama and his collection of incompetents have demonstrated that they have no competence. The regime is also corrupt, and the entire edifice rests on nothing but lies.</p>
<p>Now that the White House realizes that Obama cannot commit a war crime without cover, here is what we can likely expect. The argument will move away from whether or not Assad used chemical weapons and become an argument that Congress must not undermine US prestige and credibility by failing to support President Obama, the latest front man for American wars of aggression. </p>
<p>The White House will bribe, cajole, and intimidate the Congress. The regime’s argument will be that with America’s prestige and credibility on the line, Congress must support the President.  The President and Secretary of State have made unequivocal statements of Assad’s guilt and their determination to punish Assad. Given Washington’s insanity, the way Washington punishes Assad for (allegedly) killing Syrians with chemical weapons is for Washington to kill more Syrians with cruise missiles.  </p>
<p>If this doesn’t make sense to you, you don’t belong in Obama’s government or in the American media, and you could never be a neoconservative.  </p>
<p>The White House will argue that Obama has compromised with Congress by letting Congress vote on the decision, and that Congress’ part of the compromise is to give its support. Meet us half-way, the White House will say.</p>
<p>The Israel Lobby, Susan Rice, the neocons, and warmongers such as Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham will argue that lack of support for Obama’s attack on Syria hurts America’s credibility, aids the “terrorists” and “leaves America defenseless.”  It is bad enough, they will argue, that Obama has shown indecision by waiting for Congress’ approval and irresolution by substituting a limited strike for the original plan of regime change.</p>
<p>Faced with threats of a cutoff of campaign donation munificence from the Israel Lobby and the military/security complex, the House and Senate can be brought into line to “support the country” as it commits another war crime.  The combination of bribes, intimidation, and patriotic appeals to support America’s prestige can swing the Congress.  No one really knows if the 160 or so members of the House are sincere about putting Obama on notice, or whether they simply want something.  Perhaps they only want Obama to cough up for their approval. </p>
<p>If Congress gives its backing to another American war crime, British Prime Minister David Cameron can go back to Parliament and tell them that Obama “has now brought Congress on board, thus providing cover, and if Parliament doesn’t go along we will be cut out of the money.”</p>
<p>Few British politicians, other than George Galloway, are comfortable with being cut out of the money. </p>
<p>If Cameron brings Parliament around, the other NATO countries might decide to get on the payments bandwagon. The overriding rule of Western civilization is that more money is better than no money.</p>
<p>Washington and its NATO European puppets will criticize Russia and China for using their Security Council vetoes to block the UN from bringing justice, freedom, and democracy to Syria. These faux arguments will be used by the presstitute Western media to undermine the importance of the UN Security Council’s opposition to Washington’s attack on Syria. Why should Washington be deterred by Security Council members who support Assad’s use of chemical weapons, the US media whores will ask. The prostitutes that comprise the US media will do all in their power to ensure that Washington kills yet more Syrians. Killing is America’s hallmark.</p>
<p>As the history of humankind proves, people will do anything for money. Noteworthy  exceptions are Edward Snowden, Bradley Manning, and Julian Assange. Were any of these truth-tellers to have gone to Washington and say, “buy me,” in exchange for their silence Washington would have provided large fortunes with which they could live a life of comfort.</p>
<p>Considering how corrupted the US government is and how determined Washington is to have its way, the UN chemical weapons inspectors are at risk. It is unlikely that they will have an accident like SEAL Team Six. But unless they are sequestered like a jury, they are targets for bribery.  If the UN report doesn’t support the White House position, the Secretary General will be pressured to make the report inconclusive. After all, Washington writes the checks that keep the UN in business.</p>
<p>No one should expect the US Congress to vote on the basis of the evidence. Moreover, Congress has so far shown no understanding that regardless of whether Assad used chemical weapons, it is a war crime for the US to commit naked aggression against Syria, a country that has not attacked the US. It is not Washington’s business how the Syrian government puts down the effort by al-Nusra extremists to overthrow it. </p>
<p>Obama’s argument that it is OK to kill people with white phosphorus and depleted uranium, as the US and Israel does, but not with sarin gas, has no logic.  <a href='http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/08/the-u-s-and-israel-have-used-chemical-weapons-within-the-last-8-years.html'  target="_blank">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/08/the-u-s-and-israel-have-used-chemical-weapons-within-the-last-8-years.html<br />

Washington itself has contingency plans to use nuclear bunker busters against Iran’s underground nuclear energy facilities.  If Washington believes that weapons of mass destruction are impermissible, why does Washington have so many of them and contingency plans to use them? Is Washington regretful that Washington dropped two nuclear bombs on civilian Japanese cities at the very time that the Japanese government was doing everything in its power to surrender? </p>
<p>Ever since the dangerous Cold War ended, hot war has been the mainstay of US foreign policy. George H.W. Bush attacked Iraq after Bush’s ambassador gave Saddam Hussein the green light to attack Kuwait.  Clinton attacked Serbia on false pretenses and without any constitutional or legal authority. George W. Bush attacked Afghanistan and Iraq on the basis of lies.  Obama renewed the attack on Afghanistan and has attacked also Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia. Obama sent his NATO puppets to attack Libya, sent mercenaries into Syria, and now intends to prevent his mercenaries’ defeat by attacking Syria. </p>
<p>Washington is building a string of military bases around both Russia and China. These bases are extremely provocative and foretell nuclear war.</p>
<p>The US, a country with a vast nuclear weapons arsenal, whose political leaders are both corrupt and insane, is a great danger to life on earth.  That Washington is the number one danger to the world is now universally recognized, except by Americans who wear their patriotism on their sleeve. These gullible dupes are the enablers of the demise of humanity by war.</p>
<p>Until the US economy collapses, Washington still has printed money, and it can buy acquiescence to its crimes. Washington can rely on the presstitute media to tell its lies as if they were facts.  The world will not be safe until the American house of cards collapses.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for those uninformed Americans who think that they live in the best country in the world. Too few Americans care that their government has destroyed countless lives from Central America and Vietnam to the Middle East and Africa. The US military routinely murders civilians in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and is responsible for as many as 1,000,000 Iraqi deaths and 4,000,000 displaced Iraqis. The American definition of “the best country in the world” is the country that can murder the most innocent people, people who have never attacked America, people who once looked upon America as the hope of the world and now see a deadly threat.</p>
<p>Too many Americans have no idea that one-fifth of their fellow citizens are dependent on government support, or if they do know, they blame the unfortunate for being leeches on the taxpayers’ purse. In the US wages and employment opportunities are declining. There are no impediments to the looting of citizens by financial institutions. There are no constraints on the lawlessness and brutality of the police, and no limit to the lies that keep the American population entrapped in the Matrix unaware of reality.</p>
<p>How such a people can retain liberty or restrain a government committed to war strains the imagination.</p>
<p>Those Republicans who worry about our children’s and grandchildren’s debt burdens  are worried about a future that might never come about. Washington’s hubris is pushing the world toward nuclear war.</p>
<p>“The best country in the world” is the evil force that is destroying the lives and prospects of many different peoples and might yet destroy all life on earth.</p>

	<em>the isolation of America</em></p>
<p>Paul Craig Roberts</p>
<p>Washington preens itself on being “the world’s greatest democracy.”  Washington uses the claim that it is spreading democracy as a justification for its naked aggression&#8211;a clear and unambiguous war crime&#8211;against other countries.  Washington cloaks its illegality in democratic rhetoric despite the obvious fact that its wars are not a consequence of democratic decision. </p>
<p>Washington has used deception and lies to gain acceptance of its extra-constitutional and extra-legal wars, but Washington’s wars have all been launched outside the constitutional/democratic framework of the United States. </p>
<p>Obama’s war against Libya occurred without the participation of Congress. And now Obama is again revealing that the US is so far removed from democracy that he plans to attack Syria without a vote by Congress.  Where is the democracy when a Caesar makes the decisions that the Constitution reserves to Congress?</p>
<p>Polls indicate that 80 percent of US citizens believe that a US military attack on Syria requires approval by the House and Senate.  Yet, the Obama regime is purposely avoiding any such vote.  The Obama regime has also ignored the letter signed by 162 members of the House of Representatives demanding to see evidence, debate it, and vote prior to any US military strike.  </p>
<p>It is an act of treason for the US military to carry out any war orders without congressional authorization.  Any military commander who violates his oath to defend the Constitution of the United States has committed high treason against the United States.  If the US were truly a lawful democracy, such commanders would be subject to arrest and trial.</p>
<p>The fact that the executive branch and the military operate outside the Constitution and democratic process is proof that the US is not a democracy.</p>
<p>In yesterday’s columns I noted that Obama, his media whores, and worshiping Obamabots are overlooking considerations of critical importance.  One is that military aggression is a war crime.  In the past, Bush and Obama had cloaks for their war crimes, such as a “coalition of the willing,” NATO, some limited “congressional consultation” or vague resolution, or a UN resolution that is then stretched to cover the regime’s actions.  </p>
<p>None of these things are adequate legal cover. Their worth comes from the fact that other countries and institutions besides the US executive branch are involved in the war crime.  There is safety in the numbers.  Charging the entire Western world with war crimes means only that the entire Western world will defend the validity of their excuse.  </p>
<p>But this time the regime has no cover.  There is no “coalition of the willing,” no UN resolution, no NATO support, and Obama has ignored both Congress and the American people.  For Obama to proceed with his attack on Syria would be the action of an unaccountable dictator. He would have no cover for his war crime.</p>
<p>Obama’s effort to rush to war with Syria has already destroyed the credibility of the US government as a truthful, honest government. The entire world, even Washington’s most subservient puppet states, have recognized that Washington has no evidence to back its accusations. No one believes Obama or Kerry.  Both have revealed themselves to the entire world as brazen liars.</p>
<p>This has destroyed all trust in the US government.  And now Obama seems determined to prove that America has a dictator, not a democracy.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine a more serious blow to the US than the one Obama has delivered.<br />
All of the important props for Washington’s propaganda, such as “the world’s greatest democracy,” have been kicked out from under what now stands revealed as a criminal enterprise.</p>
<p>Russia’s President Putin has openly expressed his contempt for the lies that are flowing nonstop from the mouths of Obama and Kerry. Putin called Obama’s claims “utter nonsense.”  Putin said that if the Americans have any proof, “let them show it to the United Nations inspectors and the Security Council.”</p>
<p>In fact, the evidence that exists indicates that the chemical attack originated with the rebels and may have been an accident caused by “rebels” transporting chemical weapons given to them by the Saudis but without instruction to correct handling. The reporter, Dale Gavlak, who spoke with the rebels, who were themselves harmed by the weapons, is a Middle East expert from the University of Chicago who has reported for the Associated Press, National Public Radio, and the BBC. <a href='http://original.antiwar.com/Dale-Gavlak/2013/08/30/syrians-in-ghouta-claim-saudi-supplied-rebels-behind-chemical-attack/'  target="_blank">http://original.antiwar.com/Dale-Gavlak/2013/08/30/syrians-in-ghouta-claim-saudi-supplied-rebels-behind-chemical-attack/</a>   </p>
<p>For another perspective unreported by the US media, see Ambrose Evans-Pritchard’s report in the UK Telegraph that Saudi Prince Bandar, head of Saudi intelligence, attempted to bribe and intimidate Putin into abandoning Syria to the Americans.  Reportedly, Bandar offered Putin a Saudi-Russian oil cartel and offered Putin protection against Chechen terrorist attacks on Russia’s Winter Olympics. <a href='http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/10266957/Saudis-offer-Russia-secret-oil-deal-if-it-drops-Syria.html'  target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/10266957/Saudis-offer-Russia-secret-oil-deal-if-it-drops-Syria.html<br />
</a><br />
As farfetched as all of this sounds to Americans, it is more plausible than anything Washington says.</p>
<p>Washington’s claim that the Syrian “rebels” have no access to chemical weapons is obviously false.  On May 30, an Istanbul newspaper reported that Turkish police apprehended al-Nusra “rebels” with sarin gas that al-Nusra planed to use in an attack<br />
on Adana. <a href='http://www.todayszaman.com/news-316966-report-police-foil-al-nusra-bomb-attack-planned-for-adana.html'  target="_blank">http://www.todayszaman.com/news-316966-report-police-foil-al-nusra-bomb-attack-planned-for-adana.html </a> </p>
<p>Having repeatedly declared that the use of chemical weapons requires a military response from the US, what will Obama and Kerry do when it comes clear that the “rebels,” not Assad, are responsible for the chemical weapons?  Will Obama and Kerry attack the “rebels”?  Will Obama and Kerry attack Saudi Arabia for giving the chemical weapons to the “rebels”?  Don’t hold your breath.</p>
<p>My Ph.D. dissertation supervisor, G. Warren Nutter, was brought into the Pentagon by Melvin Laird as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs and given the task of winding down the Vietnam War.  Nutter opposed US foreign policy based on secrecy and deception. He was convinced that US foreign policy had to be transparent, consistent with the country’s principles, and carry public support.  A policy based on secrecy and deception would undermine democracy and the trust of the public and foreigners in the US government.</p>
<p>Today there are no Warren Nutters in Washington, and there have not been such people in government for many years. As Nutter foresaw, the consequences are the loss of public confidence in government and the isolation of the US in world affairs.  </p>
<p>Obama now stands on the verge of military aggression as isolated as Adolf Hitler when Germany attacked Poland.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  4:00 PM US East Coast Time</p>
<p>The White House Fool, learning from the alternative media and not from his moronic advisers that he is isolated in the world and has no cover for his war crime against Syria, has announced that he is going to wait until he gets approval from Congress.</p>
<p>No doubt the White House Fool was also moved by the letter from 161 members of the House of Representatives that to engage in hostilities without congressional authorization is unconstitutional. The letter contains the threat of impeachment:</p>
<p>“We strongly urge you to consult and receive authorization from Congress before ordering the use of U.S. military force in Syria. Your responsibility to do so is prescribed in the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution of 1973. </p>
<p>“While the Founders wisely gave the Office of the President the authority to act in emergencies, they foresaw the need to ensure public debate – and the active engagement of Congress – prior to committing U.S. military assets. Engaging our military in Syria when no direct threat to the United States exists and without prior congressional authorization would violate the separation of powers that is clearly delineated in the Constitution.”  <a href='http://antiwar.com/blog/2013/08/31/impeachment-congress-fires-opening-shot-across-obamas-bow/'  target="_blank"> http://antiwar.com/blog/2013/08/31/impeachment-congress-fires-opening-shot-across-obamas-bow/ </a> </p>
<p>We can be thankful that at least 161 members of Congress recognize their responsibility to hold the executive branch accountable to the Constitution. Perhaps the lies from the executive branch became so brazen that they lost their effectiveness.  Instead of fearing a hyped “terrorist threat,” people now see the threat of a White House Tyrant.</p>

<p>Paul Craig Roberts</p>
<p>A foolish President Obama and moronic Secretary of State Kerry have handed the  United States government its worst diplomatic defeat in history and destroyed the credibility of the Office of the President, the Department of State, and the entire executive branch. All are exposed as a collection of third-rate liars.  </p>
<p>Intoxicated with hubris from past successful lies and deceptions used to destroy Iraq and Libya, Obama thought the US “superpower,” the “exceptional” and “indispensable” country, could pull it off again, this time in Syria.</p>
<p>But the rest of the world has learned to avoid Washington’s rush to war when there is no evidence.  A foolish Obama was pushed far out on the limb by an incompetent and untrustworthy National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, and the pack of neoconservatives that support her, and the British Parliament cut the limb off.</p>
<p>What kind of fool would put himself in that vulnerable position?</p>
<p>Now Obama stands alone, isolated, trying to back away from his threat to attack without authorization from anyone&#8211;not from the UN, not from NATO, not from Congress who he ignored&#8211;a sovereign country. Under the Nuremberg Standard military aggression is a war crime. Washington has until now got away with its war crimes by cloaking them in UN or NATO approval.  Despite these “approvals,” they remain war crimes.</p>
<p>But his National Security Advisor and the neocon warmongers are telling him that he must prove that he is a Real Man who can stand alone and commit war crimes all by himself without orchestrated cover from the UN or NATO or a cowardly US Congress.  It is up to Obama, they insist, to establish for all time that the President of the United States is above all law.  He, and he alone is the “decider,” the Caesar, who determines what is permissible.  The Caesar of the “sole superpower” must now assert his authority over all law or Washington’s hegemony over the world is lost.</p>
<p>As I noted in an earlier column today, if Obama goes it alone, he will be harassed for the rest of his life as a war criminal who dares not leave the US.  Indeed, a looming economic collapse could so alter the power and attitude of the United States that Obama could find himself brought to justice for his war crimes.</p>
<p>Regardless, the United States government has lost its credibility throughout the world and will never regain it, unless the Bush and Obama regimes are arrested and put on trial for their war crimes.</p>
<p>Obama’s destruction of US credibility goes far beyond diplomacy.  It is likely that this autumn or winter, and almost certainly in 2014, the US will face severe economic crisis.</p>
<p>The long-term abuse of the US dollar’s reserve currency role by the Federal Reserve and US Treasury, the never-ending issuance of new debt and printing of dollars to finance it, the focus of US economic policy on bailing out the “banks too big to fail” regardless of the adverse impact on domestic and world economies and holders of US Treasury debt, the awaiting political crisis of the unresolved deficit and debt ceiling limit that will greet Congress’ return to Washington in September, collapsing job opportunities and a sinking economy all together present the government in Washington with a crisis that is too large for the available intelligence, knowledge, and courage to master.</p>
<p>When the proverbial hits the fan, the incompetent and corrupt Federal Reserve and the incompetent and corrupt US Treasury will have no more credibility than Obama and John Kerry.  </p>
<p>The rest of the world&#8211;especially Washington’s bullied NATO puppet states&#8211;will take great delight in the discomfort of “the world’s sole superpower” that has been running on hubris ever since the Soviet collapse. </p>
<p>The world is not going to bail out Washington, now universally hated, with currency swaps, more loans, and foreign aid.  Americans are going to pay heavily for their negligence, their inattention, their unconcern, and their ignorant belief that nothing can go wrong for them and that anything that does is temporary. </p>
<p>Two decades of jobs offshoring has left the US with a third world labor force employed in lowly paid domestic nontradable services, a workforce comparable to India’s of 40 years ago.  Already the “world’s sole superpower” is afflicted with a large percentage of its population dependent on government welfare for survival.  As the economy closes down, the government’s ability to meet the rising demands of survival diminishes. The rich will demand that the poor be sacrificed in the interest of the rich. And the political parties will comply.</p>
<p>Is this the reason that Homeland Security, a Nazi Gestapo institution, now has a large and growing para-military force equipped with tanks, drones, and billions of rounds of ammunition?</p>
<p>How long will it be before American citizens are shot down in their streets by “their” government as occurs frequently in Washington’s close allies in Egypt, Turkey, Bahrain?</p>
<p>Americans have neglected the requirements of liberty.  Americans are so patriotic and so gullible that all the government has to do is to wrap itself in the flag, and the people, or too many of them, believe whatever lie the government tells. And the gullible people will defend the government’s lie to their death, indeed, to the death of the entire world.</p>
<p>If Americans keep believing the government’s lies, they have no future.  If truth be known, Americans have already lost a livable future. The neocons’ “American Century” is over before it begun.  </p>
<p>Update:  I have heard from educated and aware friends that the presstitute media on the evening news are beating the drums for war.  This shows what paid whores the US media is and their total disconnect from reality.  Anyone who wastes their time on the US media is a brainwashed idiot, a danger to humanity. </p>
<p>Update 8:52 PM August 30:  Is the White House idiot going to be a victim of his own careless presidential appointments?<br />
Does he have no one to tell him how to escape the dilemma his moronic Secretary of State and National Security Advisor have put him in?  Someone needs to tell the WH Fool that he must say that he accepts the conclusion of the world<br />
community that there is not sufficient evidence for launching a military attack on Syria and killing even more people<br />
than were killed in the alleged, but unproven, chemical attack, and that he awaits further and better evidence.<br />

<p>Paul Craig Roberts</p>
<p>Obama, pushed by his Israeli and neocon masters, especially his National Security<br />
Advisor, Susan Rice, who, in effect, functions as an Israeli agent, crawled far out on the limb, only to have it sawed off by the British Parliament.  </p>
<p>In response, the “socialist” president of France, Hollande, who lacks French support for<br />
France’s participation in a US/Israeli orchestrated military attack on Syria, has crawled<br />
back off the limb, saying that, while everything is still on the table, he has to see some evidence first.</p>
<p>As Cameron and Obama have made clear, there is no evidence.  Even US intelligence has declared that there is no conclusive evidence that Assad used chemical weapons or even has control over the weapons.</p>
<p>Even the US puppet government in Canada has disavowed participating in the Obama/Israeli war crime.</p>
<p>This leaves Obama with support only from Turkey and Israel.  Recently, the Turkish government shot down in the streets more of its own people&#8211;peaceful protesters, not<br />
imported mercenaries trying to overthrow the Turkish government&#8211;than were killed in<br />
the alleged use of chemical weapons by Assad.</p>
<p>As the entire world is aware, the Israeli government has been committing crimes against the people in Palestine for decades. A distinguished Jewish jurist concluded in an official report that the Israeli government committed war crimes in its attack on the civilian population of Gaza.</p>
<p>No country regards the criminal states of Turkey and Israel as cover for a war crime.  If Obama is pushed by Susan Rice and the evil neocons, who are strongly allied with Israel, into going it alone and conducting a military strike on Syria, Obama will have made himself an unambiguous War Criminal under the Nuremberg Standard created by the US Government.  Unprovoked military aggression is a war crime under international law. That is completely clear. There are no ifs or buts about it.</p>
<p>If Obama now strikes Syria, when he has no cover from the UN, or from NATO, or from the American people, or from Congress, having ignored the House and Senate, Obama<br />
will stand before the entire world, starkly, as a War Criminal. Unless the world is<br />
prepared to flush international law, arrest orders for the War Criminal will have to come from the Hague. Obama will have to be handed over and put on trial.  He will have no<br />
more leg to stand on than did the Nazis.</p>
<p>The evil neocons are telling Obama that he must prove that he is a man and go it alone.<br />
If Obama does, he will prove that he is a War Criminal.</p>

<p>Alas!  The media consists only of pimps and whores for governments.</p>
<p>The US and UK governments have made it completely clear that Assad has <strong>not</strong> used chemical weapons.  If Assad had used chemical weapons,  Washington would wait for the report of the UN chemical weapons inspectors who are in Syria conducting the investigation. The UN Secretary General says that the facts should first be established before starting a war, but Washington knows that the facts will prove that the US and UK governments are liars.  Washington is desperate to attack before experts reveal the facts.</p>
<p>If the facts supported Obama and Cameron, the two warmongers would have a good chance of obtaining a UN resolution in support of their attack on Syria.  But Washington and London know that they have based everything on brazen lies.</p>
<p>The point that everyone misses, including the UN Secretary General and the Russian media, is that whether Assad used chemical weapons or not, it is still a war crime for the US and UK to commit naked aggression against Syria.  </p>
<p>The Syrian government is confronted with an invasion from outside forces, most likely recruited and most definitely encouraged and equipped by the US.  What right does Washington and London have to decide what weapons Assad can use to resist an invasion?  Who gave Washington the right to use nuclear weapons on Japan, to use depleted uranium and white phosphorus in its half dozen wars against Muslim peoples?</p>
<p>The US and UK governments are criminal organizations, but unlike the Mafia they are devoid of all honor. They are the worst of the worst. And they are also stupid. “Weapons of mass destruction” worked for them in Iraq [I said Iran in the interview but meant Iraq], and they are using the same excuse for attacking Syria. But the world doesn’t believe them this time.  Washington and London have ensnared themselves in their own hubris, and this time the entire world will recognize them for the war criminals that they are.  With any luck, the outcome will be the isolation of the criminal states of US, UK, and Israel from the civilized world.</p>
<p>In the interview with RT, I ask when in the 21st century have the US and UK governments ever told the truth about anything?  Think about that and see what you can come up with.</p>

<p>UPDATE AUGUST 29</p>
<p><em>The British Parliament has rejected British military intervention in Syria. The US puppet, Cameron, who<br />
serves as Prime Minister was forced to admit that he had no evidence that Assad had used chemical weapons,<br />
and Parliament said, no evidence, no war.  It is unlikely the French will go along without the British,<br />
so this leaves Obama all alone with Israel.  If Washington goes ahead with the strike, Obama will be<br />
branded with the War Criminal moniker.  </em></p>
<p>The decisive action by Parliament shames the cowardly US Congress.</p>
<p><a href='http://rt.com/news/uk-parliament-vote-syria-181/' >http://rt.com/news/uk-parliament-vote-syria-181/</a></p>
<p><em>Update:</p>
<p>The war criminals in Washington and other Western capitals are determined to maintain their lie that the Syrian government used chemical weapons.  Having failed in efforts to intimidate the UN chemical inspectors in Syria, Washington has demanded that UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon withdraw the chemical weapons inspectors before they can assess the evidence and make their report.  The UN Secretary General stood up to the Washington war criminals and rejected their demand. However, as with Iraq, Washington&#8217;s decision to commit aggression against Syria is not based on any facts. <a href='http://rt.com/op-edge/syria-un-war-investigation-006/'  target="_blank">http://rt.com/op-edge/syria-un-war-investigation-006/ </a></p>
<p>The US and UK governments have revealed none of the “conclusive evidence” they claim to have that the Syrian government used chemical weapons. Listening to their voices, observing their body language, and looking into their eyes,  it is completely obvious that John Kerry and his British and German puppets are lying through their teeth.  This is a far more shameful situation than the massive lies that former Secretary of State Colin Powell told the UN about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.  Colin Powell claims that he was deceived by the White House and did not know that he was lying.  Kerry and the British, French, and German puppets know full well that they are lying.  </p>
<p>The face that the West presents to the world is the brazen face of a liar. </p>
<p></em><br />
Washington and its British and French puppet governments are poised to yet again reveal their criminality. The image of the West as War Criminal is not a propaganda image created by the West’s enemies, but the portrait that the West has painted of itself. </p>
<p>The UK Independent reports that over this past week-end Obama, Cameron, and Hollande agreed to launch cruise missile attacks against the Syrian government within two weeks despite the lack of any authorization from the UN and despite the absence of any evidence in behalf of Washington’s claim that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons against the Washington-backed “rebels”, largely US supported external forces, seeking to overthrow the Syrian government.</p>
<p>Indeed, one reason for the rush to war is to prevent the UN inspection that Washington knows would disprove its claim and possibly implicate Washington in the false flag attack by the “rebels,” who assembled a large number of children into one area to be chemically murdered with the blame pinned by Washington on the Syrian government.  </p>
<p>Another reason for the rush to war is that Cameron, the UK prime minister, wants to get the war going before the British parliament can block him for providing cover for Obama’s war crimes the way that Tony Blair provided cover for George W. Bush, for which Blair was duly rewarded. What does Cameron care about Syrian lives when he can leave office into the waiting arms of a $50 million fortune.<br />

<p>The Syrian government, knowing that it is not responsible for the chemical weapons incident, has agreed for the UN to send in chemical inspectors to determine the substance used and the method of delivery.  However, Washington has declared that it is “too late” for UN inspectors and that Washington accepts the self-serving claim of the al Qaeda affiliated “rebels” that the Syrian government attacked civilians with chemical weapons.  <a href='http://news.antiwar.com/2013/08/25/obama-administration-accepts-rebels-account-on-syria-prepares-for-war/'  target="_blank">http://news.antiwar.com/2013/08/25/obama-administration-accepts-rebels-account-on-syria-prepares-for-war/</a>   See also <a href='http://news.antiwar.com/2013/08/25/syria-accepts-un-inspectors-us-spurns-call-as-too-late/'  target="_blank">http://news.antiwar.com/2013/08/25/syria-accepts-un-inspectors-us-spurns-call-as-too-late/<br />
</a></p>
<p>In an attempt to prevent the UN chemical inspectors who arrived on the scene from doing their work, the inspectors were fired upon by snipers in “rebel” held territory and forced off site, although a later report from RT says the inspectors have returned to the site to conduct their inspection.  <a href='http://rt.com/news/un-chemical-oservers-shot-000/'  target="_blank">http://rt.com/news/un-chemical-oservers-shot-000/<br />
</a></p>
<p>The corrupt British government has declared that Syria can be attacked without UN authorization, just as Serbia and Libya were militarily attacked without UN authorization. In other words, the Western democracies have already established precedents for violating international law.  “International law? We don’t need no stinking international law!”  The West knows only one rule:  Might is Right.  As long as the West has the Might, the West has the Right.  </p>
<p>In a response to the news report that the US, UK, and France are preparing to attack Syria, the Russian Foreign Minister, Lavrov, said that such unilateral action is a “severe violation of international law,” and that the violation was not only a legal one but also an ethical and moral violation.  Lavrov referred to the lies and deception used by the West to justify its grave violations of international law in military attacks on Serbia, Iraq, and Libya and how the US government used preemptive moves to undermine every hope for peaceful settlements in Iraq, Libya, and Syria. </p>
<p>Once again Washington has preempted any hope of peaceful settlement. By announcing the forthcoming attack, the US destroyed any incentive for the “rebels” to participate in the peace talks with the Syrian government. On the verge of these talks taking place, the “rebels” now have no incentive to participate as the West’s military is coming to their aid.</p>
<p>In his press conference Lavrov spoke of how the ruling parties in the US, UK, and France stir up emotions among poorly informed people that, once aroused, have to be satisfied by war.  This, of course, is the way the US manipulated the public in order to attack Afghanistan and Iraq. But the American public is tired of the wars, the goal of which is never made clear, and has grown suspicious of the government’s justifications for more wars.</p>
<p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll finds that “Americans strongly oppose U.S. intervention in Syria’s civil war and believe Washington should stay out of the conflict even if reports that Syria’s government used deadly chemicals to attack civilians are confirmed.” <a href='http://news.yahoo.com/syria-war-escalates-americans-cool-u-intervention-reuters-003146054.html'  target="_blank">http://news.yahoo.com/syria-war-escalates-americans-cool-u-intervention-reuters-003146054.html</a>  However, Obama could not care less that only 9 percent of the public supports his warmongering. As former president Jimmy Carter recently stated, “America has no functioning democracy.” <a href='http://rt.com/usa/carter-comment-nsa-snowden-261/'  target="_blank">http://rt.com/usa/carter-comment-nsa-snowden-261/</a>   It has a police state in which the executive branch has placed itself above all law and the Constitution.</p>
<p>This police state is now going to commit yet another Nazi-style war crime of unprovoked aggression.  At Nuremberg the Nazis were sentenced to death for precisely the identical actions being committed by Obama, Cameron, and Hollande.  The West is banking on might, not right,  to keep it out of the criminal dock.</p>
<p>The US, UK, and French governments have not explained why it matters whether people in the wars initiated by the West are killed by explosives made of depleted uranium or with chemical agents or any other weapon.  It was obvious from the beginning that Obama was setting up the Syrian government for attack. Obama demonized chemical weapons&#8211;but not nuclear “bunker busters” that the US might use on Iran. Then Obama drew a red line, saying that the use of chemical weapons by the Syrians was such a great crime that the West would be obliged to attack Syria.  Washington’s UK puppets, William Hague and Cameron, have just repeated this nonsensical claim. <a href='http://rt.com/news/uk-response-without-un-backing-979/'  target="_blank">http://rt.com/news/uk-response-without-un-backing-979/ </a> The final step in the frame-up was to orchestrate a chemical incident and blame the Syrian government.</p>
<p><em>What is the West’s real agenda?</em>  This is the unasked and unanswered question. Clearly, the US, UK, and French governments, which have displayed continuously their support for dictatorial regimes that serve their purposes, are not the least disturbed by dictatorships.  They brand Assad a dictator as a means of demonizing him for the ill-informed Western masses.  But Washington, UK, and France support any number of dictatorial regimes, such as the ones in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and now the military dictatorship in Egypt that is ruthlessly killing Egyptians without any Western government speaking of invading Egypt for “killing its own people.”</p>
<p>Clearly also, the forthcoming Western attack on Syria has nothing whatsoever to do with bringing “freedom and democracy” to Syria any more than freedom and democracy were reasons for the attacks on Iraq and Libya, neither of which gained any “freedom and democracy.” </p>
<p>The Western attack on Syria is unrelated to human rights, justice or any of the high sounding causes with which the West cloaks its criminality.  </p>
<p>The Western media, and least of all the American presstitutes, never ask Obama, Cameron, or Hollande what the real agenda is.  It is difficult to believe than any reporter is sufficiently stupid or gullible to believe that the agenda is bringing “freedom and democracy” to Syria or punishing Assad for allegedly using chemical weapons against murderous thugs trying to overthrow the Syrian government.  </p>
<p>Of course, the question wouldn’t be answered if asked.  But the act of asking it would help make the public aware that more is afoot than meets the eye.  Originally, the excuse for Washington’s wars was to keep Americans safe from terrorists.  Now Washington is endeavoring to turn Syria over to jihad terrorists by helping them to overthrow the secular, non-terrorist Assad government. What is the agenda behind Washington’s support of terrorism?  </p>
<p>Perhaps the purpose of the wars is to radicalize Muslims and, thereby, destabilize Russia and even China.  Russia has large populations of Muslims and is bordered by Muslim countries. Even China has some Muslim population. As radicalization spreads strife into the only two countries capable of being an obstacle to Washington’s world hegemony, Western media propaganda and the large number of US financed NGOs, posing as “human rights” organizations, can be counted on by Washington to demonize the Russian and Chinese governments for harsh measures against “rebels.” </p>
<p>Another advantage of the radicalization of Muslims is that it leaves former Muslim countries in long-term turmoil or civil wars, as is currently the case in Iraq and Libya, thus removing any organized state power from obstructing Israeli purposes. </p>
<p>Secretary of State John Kerry is working the phones using bribes and threats to build acceptance, if not support, for Washington’s war crime-in-the-making against Syria.</p>
<p>Washington is driving the world closer to nuclear war than it ever was even in the most dangerous periods of the Cold War. When Washington finishes with Syria, the next target is Iran.  Russia and China will no longer be able to fool themselves that there is any system of international law or restraint on Western criminality.  Western aggression is already forcing both countries to develop their strategic nuclear forces and to curtail the Western-financed NGOs that pose as “human rights organizations,” but in reality comprise a fifth column that Washington can use to destroy the legitimacy of the Russian and Chinese governments. </p>
<p>Russia and China have been extremely careless in their dealings with the United States. Essentially, the Russian political opposition is financed by Washington. Even the Chinese government is being undermined. When a US corporation opens a company in China, it creates a Chinese board on which are put relatives of the local political authorities.  These boards create a conduit for payments that influence the decisions and loyalties of local and regional party members. The US has penetrated Chinese universities and intellectual attitudes. The Rockefeller University is active in China as is Rockefeller philanthropy. Dissenting voices are being created that are arrayed against the Chinese government. Demands for “liberalization” can resurrect regional and ethnic differences and undermine the cohesiveness of the national government. </p>
<p>Once Russia and China realize that they are riven with American fifth columns, isolated diplomatically, and outgunned militarily, nuclear weapons become the only guarantor of their sovereignty. This suggests that nuclear war is likely to terminate humanity well before humanity succumbs to global warming or rising national debts.</p>

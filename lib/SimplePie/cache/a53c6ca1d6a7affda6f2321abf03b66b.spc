They&#8217;d pass no more laws, no more restrictions, and they&#8217;d finally be out of our lives (and, as a side effect, the President would apparently have to do his own laundry!).

It would be painful to be sure, as tens of millions of Americans would almost immediately lose access to the social safety net that is keeping the whole thing afloat. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-20155" alt="government closed" src="http://shtfplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/government-closed.jpg" width="450" height="272" /></p>
<p>There is a considerable amount of debate in alternative economic circles as to whether a federal government shutdown would be a “good thing” or a “bad thing”.  Frankly, even I am partially conflicted.  I love to read mainstream news stories about how a shutdown in the capital would be “horrible” because Barack Obama might have to reduce the White House cleaning staff and wash his own laundry:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-27/obama-stripped-to-skeleton-staff-in-a-government-shutdown.html">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-27/obama-stripped-to-skeleton-staff-in-a-government-shutdown.html</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s about time that sellout bastard did something to clean up his own act.  I also love the idea of the federal government out of the picture and removed from the U.S. dynamic.  Americans need to learn again how to live without the nanny state, even if only for a few weeks, and what better way than to go cold turkey.  I can hear the tortured sobs of the socialists now, crying for their SNAP cards and low grade government healthcare.  It&#8217;s like&#8230;beautiful music&#8230;</p>
<p>That said, as much as centralized government needs to be erased from the face of the planet, there are, indeed, consequences that must be dealt with.  It is foolish to believe otherwise.  No social system, and I mean NO SOCIAL SYSTEM, changes without pain to the population.  I am not among those that cheer a federal shutdown, because I understand that the only people to ultimately feel suffering will be average citizens, not the establishment itself.  The sheeple may be ignorant and blind, but no one deserves the kind of unmitigated hellfire that could rain down upon our country if a shutdown continues for an extended period of time.  Call me a humanitarian&#8230;</p>
<p>As I write this, mainstream media projections estimate a 90% chance of government shutdown by midnight on September 30th.  Though technically, government funds will not run out until October 17th:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/09/25/treasury-debt-limit-october-17/2867471/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/09/25/treasury-debt-limit-october-17/2867471/</a></p>
<p>We have dealt with this kind of talk before over the past few years, and it&#8217;s interesting to see the kind of cynicism that has developed over the idea of a shutdown event.  After all, the last time a government shutdown occurred was at the end of 1995, lasting only a couple of weeks into 1996.  The GOP has folded so many times over the U.S. budget and debt ceiling that most of the public expects they will obviously do it again.  It is certainly possible that the Republicans will roll over, however, I am not so sure of that this time around.  Why?  Not because Obamacare is on the table.  Obamacare is just a distraction.  No, I&#8217;m far more interested in the circumstances surrounding the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Obamacare is designed to fail.  Anyone with any financial or mathematical sense could look at the real national debt and deficit projections of the U.S. and understand that there is no money and never will be enough money to fund universal healthcare.  The GOP could simply let the program take effect, sit back, and watch it crash and burn over the next three to five years.  This would entail, though, watching the whole of our economy crash and burn with it.</p>
<p>What we have developing in front of us is the recipe for a new false paradigm.  Already, the MSM is discussing the possibility of debt default and who will be responsible under such circumstances.  Not surprisingly “Tea Party” conservatives have been named the primary culprits if a shutdown goes south; even former Democratic president Bill Clinton is getting in on the blame game:</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/09/bill-clinton-when-it-comes-to-obamacare-gop-begging-for-america-to-fail/">http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/09/bill-clinton-when-it-comes-to-obamacare-gop-begging-for-america-to-fail/</a></p>
<p>All the bickering over Obamacare is fascinating, I&#8217;m sure, but lets set the Affordable Care Act aside for a moment and look at the bigger and more important picture.  The private Federal Reserve Bank has just announced to much surprise a complete reversal on its suggested QE “taper” measures, resulting in a shocked and confused marketplace.  If the U.S. fiscal system is stable and sound, as the Fed has been suggesting for the past year, then why continue stimulus measures at all?  Could it be that most if not all positive economic numbers released by the Fed and the Labor Department are actually fake, and that investors have been duped into assuming overall growth when America is actually in an accelerated decline?   Wouldn&#8217;t that be a high speed excrement storm straight out of left field!</p>
<p>The first day rally over the Fed announcement faded quickly, resulting in a slow bleed of the Dow ever since.  The magic of Fed stimulus is wearing off, and the investment world is not happy.  If I were a member of the Federal Reserve Bank, I suppose I would appreciate a large scale distraction designed to take attention away from me and my elitist club-mates as the primary culprits behind the greatest currency implosion in the history of the world.</p>
<p>Sadly, a government shutdown is sizable threat to the American financial system, and few people seem to get it.  Perhaps because the expectation is that any shutdown would only be a short term concern.  And, this assumption might be correct.  But, if a shutdown takes place, and, if “gridlock” continues for an extended period of time, I have little doubt that the U.S economy will experience renewed crisis.  Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<p><strong>Exponential Debt</strong></p>
<p>Obamacare only tops a long list of already existing “unfunded liabilities” (otherwise known as entitlement programs).  These programs are not counted in the government&#8217;s official calculations of national debt or deficit spending, but they cost taxpayers money all the same.  True deficit costs and national debt costs expand every year without fail.  If the debt ceiling does not rise in accordance with this exponential debt, a default is inevitable.  No amount of increased taxes could ever fill the black hole already created by negative government spending.</p>
<p>A long term government shutdown will eventually require cuts in entitlements, if not a total overhaul of certain aid programs.  Imagine an end to all disability payments, including veterans disability payments.  Imagine federal employee pensions put on hold for an undesignated period of time.  Imagine food stamps placed on hiatus for 50 million people.  Imagine how many states now rely on federal funding just to keep municipalities from bankruptcy.  Get the picture now?</p>
<p><strong>End Of Foreign Faith In U.S. Treasuries</strong></p>
<p>In a disgusting display of propaganda, media outlet Reuters has released an article claiming that, default or not, Asian investors and central banks are “hostage” to U.S. debt:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/29/us-usa-debt-asia-analysis-idUSBRE98S0GY20130929">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/29/us-usa-debt-asia-analysis-idUSBRE98S0GY20130929</a></p>
<p>Their argument essentially revolves around the lie that Asian investors believe an American default to be “unthinkable”.  Surely, the unnamed Japanese investment source they cite as an “insider” truly represents the whole of Asia.</p>
<p>The reality is, the Asians (the Chinese in particular) have been preparing for a calamity in the U.S. Treasury market for years.</p>
<p>Most foreign investors in U.S. Treasuries have converted their long term bond holdings to short term bond holdings; meaning, they are ready to liquidate their bonds at a moment&#8217;s notice.  Overall purchase levels of treasuries are either static, or falling depending on the nation involved.</p>
<p>China has been internationalizing its currency, the Yuan, since 2005.  China has opened Yuan “clearing houses in multiple countries to allow faster convertibility of the Yuan, quietly supplanting the dollar as the world reserve currency.  These clearing houses now exist in London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Kenya.  The Federal Reserve and international banks like <a href="http://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/Handbook_Global_RMB_Handbook_for_Financial_Institutions.pdf?blobkey=id&amp;blobwhere=1320592360689&amp;blobheader=application/pdf&amp;blobheadername1=Cache-Control&amp;blobheadervalue1=private&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs">JP Morgan are heavily involved in the internationalization of the Yuan</a>.</p>
<p>The assertion that Asia is somehow hostage to U.S. debt is a lie beyond all proportions.  In truth, the U.S. economy is actually hostage to Asian holdings of U.S. debt.  A call for a dump of U.S. treasury bonds by China, for example, in the face of a U.S. default, would immediately result in a global chain reaction ending in the destruction of the dollar as the world reserve currency.  This is not speculation, this is mathematical fact.  China is not going to sit back and do nothing while their investment in U.S. debt quickly disintegrates.  Why would they take the chance when they could could just sell, sell, sell!</p>
<p>The very idea that Reuters is attempting to twist the fundamentals surrounding a default event leads me to believe a default event may be preordained.</p>
<p><strong>What Will Be Defunded?</strong></p>
<p>Non-essential personnel (which apparently includes Obama&#8217;s maids), will be the first to receive a pink slip from the federal government.  Extra Pentagon staff, EPA staff, FDA staff, IRS staff, etc will all be cut.  Good riddance.  But what will follow will not be so pleasant.</p>
<p>If a shutdown stretches for months, expect cuts in all support programs and entitlements.  Veterans disability checks, social security, Medicare, employee pensions, even the Postal Service is likely to undergo defunding.  National Parks, and schools that receive federal aid will discover immediate cash-loss.  In fact, any state or city that relies on federal funds should plan for the possibility that those funds will disappear.</p>
<p>Military cuts would be at the bottom of the list, but I would not discount the chance of that either.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied; an enormous subsection of the American public is dependent on federal money.  If that money dries up, chaos will ensue.  I don&#8217;t like it, but it is a concern.</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Reaction</strong></p>
<p>A long term shutdown will be catastrophe no matter how you slice it.  Foreign creditors will react harshly.  The bond market will see a haircut not unlike that given to investors in Greek treasuries.  Austerity will become an American way of life.  The only mitigating factor will be the Federal Reserve, which I believe may institute “extraordinary measures” without congressional consent in order to continue feeding stimulus into government regardless of whether the debt ceiling is raised or not.  Given enough desperation, the American public might even applaud such an action and praise the Fed as “heroic”.</p>
<p>In this situation, the U.S. would be facing a Weimar-style currency collapse, rather than a debt default.  But in either scenario, the dollar is the final target.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, too many economic analysts presume that the only threat to the dollar&#8217;s value is hyperinflation (these are the same people that quote the Fed&#8217;s crooked CPI numbers).  But the dollar is just as vulnerable to a debt default and loss of reserve status.  Devaluation seems to be inevitable regardless of the outcome of the funding debate.</p>
<p>The Republicans could still surrender, and even if they don&#8217;t, real damages will not be felt until after October 17th.  This is plenty of time to manipulate the public into demanding more spending even when more spending is not in our best interests in the long term.  Our greatest concern, though, should be whether or not the establishment is ready to pull the plug on the dollar altogether, using the debt ceiling crisis as cover in order to distract away from the involvement of international banks in the overall problem.  There is no doubt given the facts at hand that America is on the edge of a terrible pyre.  Is this the event that will finally trigger collapse?  We&#8217;ll know more in a week&#8230;</p>

<p>The assault on the U.S. Constitution and the Second Amendment continues.</p>
<p>This time big business is getting into the mix and they&#8217;re aiming for gun stores right at the source of their revenues &#8211; their transaction processing facilities.</p>
<p>According to Larry Hyatt, owner of the largest gun brokerage firm in the United States, Authorize.net, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Visa USA and one of the world&#8217;s largest credit card processing gateways, has <a href="http://www.storyleak.com/credit-card-company-cuts-ties-countrys-largest-gun-shop-gun-sales/" target="_blank">terminated their relationship with the firm</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>After four years in business with the Visa owned Authorize.net, Larry Hyatt, owner of Hyatt Gun Shop, received an email indicating that the company would no longer provide its services due to “the sale of firearms or any similar product.”</p>
<p>The email reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Hyatt Gun Shop Inc,</p>
<p><strong>Authorize.Net LLC (“Authorize.Net”) has determined that the nature of your business constitutes a violation of Section 2.xiv of the Authorize.Net Acceptable Use Guidelines</strong> and Sections 3.3 and 11.3 of the Authorize.Net Service Agreement (the “Agreement”).</p>
<p><strong>These sections include, but are not limited to, the sale of firearms or any similar product.</strong></p>
<p>Accordingly, pursuant to Section 4 of the Acceptable Use Guidelines, your ability to access and use the Authorize.Net <strong>Services will be terminated on September 30, 2013.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Hyatt’s massive online store will be unable to process credit card transactions</strong>, giving the store only a few days to find a new processing company before Authorize.net terminates their business relationship.</p>
<p><strong>“We’ve never seen anything like this,”</strong> Hyatt Marketing Director Justin Anderson told the Washington Examiner.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of a sudden, after four years of doing business together, Authorize.net declares that Hyatt Gun Shop is in violation of their terms of agreement.</p>
<p>An odd coincidence to be sure, but not if you consider that many top executives at Visa <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/article/2536417" target="_blank">have donated</a> to President Obama&#8217;s election campaigns. With President Obama <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/more-obama-executive-orders-on-guns-in-wake-of-navy-yard-shooting_092013" target="_blank">renewing his push for gun control</a> in the wake of the Navy Yard shooting last week, and Americans ardently opposing any legislative action that would further restrict the ownership of firearms, it looks as if anti-gun politicians are now calling in favors with their connections in big business.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t outlaw the guns, then strike directly at the companies who manufacture them and sell them by cutting off their cash flow.</p>
<p>This is exactly what Authorize.net, which processes credit card transactions for millions of merchants around the world, has done to Hyatt.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, after a similar anti-gun push following the Sandy Hook elementary school tragedy, Bank of America took it upon themselves to <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/outrage-bank-of-america-freezes-funds-of-licensed-online-gun-dealer-we-believe-you-should-not-be-selling-guns-on-the-internet_01072013" target="_blank">forcibly seize funds from licensed firearms dealer</a> and manufacturer American Spirit Arms.</p>
<p>The incidents with Hyatt Gun Shop and American Spirit Arms are certainly not isolated and will likely continue as government and business merge their agendas, especially as it pertains to our government sponsored banking system, which has a stranglehold over American businesses.</p>
<p>The Constitution remains a prominent roadblock for the anti-gun establishment, and despite efforts to ban semi-automatic rifles, <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/new-government-initiative-to-circumvent-second-amendment-targets-ammunition-not-guns_02222012" target="_blank">tax ammunition</a>, and <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/executive-action-obama-to-ban-importation-of-ammo-magazines-and-gun-accessories-without-congressional-approval_04232013" target="_blank">restrict importation of magazines and gun parts</a>, they are being countered at every turn by the tens of millions of Americans who believe in their personal right to bear arms.</p>
<p>Thus, government is now relying on their incestuous relationships with the many bailed out banks and businesses who are essentially under their control.</p>
<p>If you think this was an accident, you&#8217;re kidding yourself.</p>
<p>A coordinated effort is underway to make it difficult, if not impossible, to acquire self defense armaments that include guns, ammo, and accessories.</p>
<p>Get &#8216;em while you can. We saw what happened with the ammunition. Now it seems they are trying to lock-down our ability to do business with legitimate gun dealers.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><small>(Pictured: Thousands of commuters at Grand Central Station try to figure out how to get home amid power outage)</small></em></p>
<p>Outgoing Department of Homeland Security Head Janet Napolitano has repeatedly <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/youve-been-warned-why-you-need-to-be-ready-for-total-grid-failure-09232013" target="_blank">warned of the imminence of a widespread power outage</a> originating from a rogue attack on the nation&#8217;s electricity grid.</p>
<p>They know such an event is coming, and in a couple of months they&#8217;ll be running a full-scale simulation involving hundreds of government agencies and businesses across North America to prepare for it.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that America is not ready for such an event &#8211; be it a man-made attack or a natural disaster.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning a massive power outage struck New York City&#8217;s metro rail system, stranding thousands of passengers and causing hours-long traffic delays in and out of the city.</p>
<p>This is just a taste of what we can expect if it were to happen nationwide all at once:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tens of thousands of commuters scrambled Thursday for alternative transportation between the Connecticut suburbs and the city as a power failure disabled one of the nation&#8217;s busiest commuter rail lines for a second day.</p>
<p>Parts of Interstate 95 were backed up for hours as transit officials scrambled to find alternative power sources and avoid what they said could be weeks of snarled commutes.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Amtrak trips between New York and Boston are running as much as 90 minutes late because of congestion caused by the commuter line outage.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for Metro-North, said officials are working to accommodate riders after power was lost along an 8-mile stretch of track&#8230;  The line serves 125,000 daily passengers at 38 stations in 23 towns.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy warned that repairs could take more than three weeks.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;This is not an act of God as we normally treat weather conditions,&#8221; he said standing in Grand Central Thursday night. &#8220;This is a failure, for one reason or another, of the system.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The New York-based utility Consolidated Edison plans to set up three transformers to bring 13,000 volts to a line that failed Wednesday, but it is unclear how many trains could be served with the added power since the line normally requires 138,000 volts, Malloy said.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;There appears to have been little to no plan for this type of catastrophic failure,&#8221;</strong> he said, explaining that a two to three week repair time was unacceptable.</p>
<p>The source of a power failure has not yet been determined, said Allan Drury, spokesman for the utility Consolidated Edison.</p>
<p><em>Source: <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/26/power-failure-commuters-new-york-connecticut/2876761/" target="_blank">USA Today</a> via <a href="http://www.stevequayle.com/" target="_blank">Steve Quayle</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>After hundreds of billions of dollars spent by Homeland Security, FEMA and other emergency agencies, there was no plan!</p>
<p>It should be clear that, despite all of the rhetoric coming from emergency planners over the last decade, New York City (and the country as a whole) is <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/gaping-holes-in-power-water-oil-and-gas-grids-40-of-utility-companies-expect-attack-in-the-next-12-months_04222011" target="_blank">totally exposed to a large-scale catastrophic emergency</a> that brings down the power grid.</p>
<p>This isolated incident, like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, prove yet again that the system as a whole will <a href="https://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/shock-72-hours-after-grid-down-starvation-supply-shortages-food-lines-no-clean-water-no-gas-transportation-standstill-independent-reports-pics-and-video_11012012" target="_blank">break down rapidly</a> should disaster strike on a mass scale.</p>
<p>Whether a grid-down event comes a as result of a <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/big-sis-says-cyber-attack-will-bring-down-power-grid-when-not-if/" target="_blank">cyber attack</a>, <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/emergency-preparedness/super-emp-capable-of-disabling-power-grid-across-lower-48-states_06202011" target="_blank">super EMP weapon</a>, or a <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/congresswoman-100-chance-of-a-severe-geo-magnetic-event-capable-of-crippling-our-electric-grid_092013" target="_blank">solar flare from the sun</a>, the consequences would be devastating and almost instantaneous.</p>
<p><strong>Millions of people would be stranded with no way to get home. Grocery and convenience stores would empty of food and potable water within a matter of hours, perhaps even minutes. Transportation, communication and commerce systems would come to a standstill.</strong></p>
<p>This would be nothing short of one of the most <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/emergency-preparedness/how-horrific-will-it-be-for-the-non-prepper_05122012" target="_blank">horrific scenarios</a> imaginable.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, as evidenced by the events in New York, should the three major power grids across the country go down, there is no bringing them back in a timely fashion. Former Congressman Roscoe Bartlett has warned that the grid components required, such as transformers, are not easily available and could take as long as 18 months to bring online.</p>
<blockquote><p>We could have events in the future where the power grid will go down and it’s not, in any reasonable time, coming back up. For instance, if when the power grid went down some of our large transformers were destroyed, damaged beyond use, we don’t make any of those in this country.</p>
<p>They’re made overseas and you order one and 18 months to two years later they will deliver it.</p>
<p><strong>Our power grid is very vulnerable. It’s very much on edge. Our military knows that.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/GGE1omIaRMI" height="270" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a huge problem, and one that promises to lead to a widespread population &#8220;die-off&#8221;, as noted by a recent study from the <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/emergency-preparedness/emp-threat-within-one-year-9-out-of-10-americans-would-be-dead_05042010" target="_blank">Center for Security Policy</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Within a year of that attack, nine out of 10 Americans would be dead, because we can’t support a population of the present size in urban centers and the like without electricity,” said Frank Gaffney, president of the Center for Security Policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s why Roscoe Bartlett and others have suggested that those with the ability to do so should <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/emergency-preparedness/congressman-warns-those-who-can-should-move-their-families-out-of-the-city_05272011" target="_blank">move their families out of major cities</a> and prepare an <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/when-the-grid-goes-down-you-better-be-ready_22082013/" target="_blank">individual preparedness plan</a> to ready themselves for the <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/emergency-preparedness/congressman-bartlett-every-citizen-should-develop-an-individual-emergency-plan-to-prepare-for-the-absence-of-government-assistance-for-extended-periods_08212012" target="_blank">absence of government assistance for extended periods</a>.</p>
<p>The threat is real and today&#8217;s events in New York should make it clear to everyone that we are not ready for it.</p>

<p>If so you may want to reconsider your options. Because if the following report from the <em>Institute of Justice</em> is any indication, nothing you hold in a private bank account account is safe anymore.</p>
<blockquote><p>Can the government use civil forfeiture to take your money when you have done nothing wrong—and then pocket the proceeds?</p>
<p>The IRS thinks so.</p>
<p>For over 30 years, Terry Dehko has successfully run a grocery store in Fraser, Mich., with his daughter Sandy.  In January 2013, without warning,<strong> the federal government used civil forfeiture to seize all of the money from the Dehkos’ store bank account (more than $35,000) even though they’ve done absolutely nothing wrong.</strong></p>
<p>Their American Dream is now a nightmare.</p>
<p>Federal civil forfeiture law features an appalling lack of due process:  <strong>It empowers the government to seize private property from Americans without ever charging, let alone convicting, them of a crime.  Perversely, the government then pockets the proceeds while providing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no prompt way to get a court to review the seizure</span>. </strong></p>
<p>On September 25, 2013, Terry and Sandy teamed up with the Institute for Justice to fight back in federal court.  A victory will vindicate not just their right to be free from abusive forfeiture tactics, but the right of every American not to have their property wrongfully seized by government.</p>

<p>Every year the government of the United States seizes tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer money and redistributes these funds to &#8220;black&#8221; projects which are often unaccounted for. On September 10th, 2001, for example, Sec. of Defense <a href="http://www.infowars.com/rumsfeld-says-2-3-trillion-never-lost-just-untracked/" target="_blank">Donald Rumsfeld admitted that the D.O.D. had lost</a> around $2.3 <strong>T</strong>rillion. The funds were unaccounted for and any investigation into where they went ended the following day when the office holding the records in question was reportedly destroyed in the Pentagon attack.</p>
<p>No one was held to account. No one went to jail. No one was punished.</p>
<p>Make a suspicious transaction or can&#8217;t account for your money as a private citizen, however, and they will seize everything you own and treat you like a financial terrorist.</p>
<p>There are no warrants, no charges, no court proceedings. They just take it. And if you don&#8217;t comply, they&#8217;ll send an <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/republican-rep-notices-irs-agents-training-with-ar-15s-during-dhs-tour-im-looking-into-the-issue-now_062013" target="_blank">IRS SWAT team</a> through your front door and imprison you.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s frightening about the experience of Terry and Sandy Dehko is that just months prior to their seizure of their assets the Internal Revenue Service completed an audit indicating that all of their records were legitimate, and their small business was operating within the guidelines of Federal tax law.</p>
<p>No matter.</p>
<p>When surveillance state flagging algorithms spotted them depositing suspicious amounts of money just below the $10,000 required federal reporting limit into their bank account, a necessity for the Dehkos because their insurance only covered up to $10,000 in losses, they were red flagged by automated monitoring systems as possible money launderers.</p>
<p>Their $35,000 was subsequently seized <strong>after the IRS filed a secret warrant</strong> (a lot of that going around these days) accusing them of &#8220;structuring.&#8221; Because of the nature of civil forfeiture laws they now have to fight for their own money and prove their activities were legal. The IRS required no proof whatsoever.</p>
<p>An accusation was enough.</p>
<p>These heavy handed practices will not get any better going forward, especially considering the fiscal state of our nation.</p>
<p>The IRS and other government agencies are booming, hiring on thousands of new employees for enforcement, and <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/are-all-those-guns-and-ammunition-for-obamas-civilian-national-security-force_022013" target="_blank">arming them with assault weapons and ammunition</a> for those who reuse to comply.</p>
<p>Last year the government took in over $4 billion in forfeiture money. How much of that was from Americans like the Dehkos, who did nothing wrong?</p>
<p>One day soon, they will come for your money, too &#8211; and probably a whole lot more.</p>
<p>Do you need any more reason to get out of the banking system, or will you wait until they take everything you&#8217;ve worked for?</p>

<p>Senator Diane Feinstein has taken up the fight for truth and liberty, just as she has done for health care and the <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/turn-them-over-feinstein-moves-to-ban-all-assault-rifles-high-capacity-magazines-and-pistol-grips_11072012" target="_blank">widespread disarmament</a> of American citizens.</p>
<p>This month Congess has been debating a new <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-shield-law-20130913,0,4553946.story" target="_blank">media shield law</a>, which according to its authors, aims to protect journalists and bloggers from being forced to testify about their work should their sources or information come into question.</p>
<p>But Diane Feinstein has refused to support the bill, noting that the law would essentially grant this shield privilege to anyone who chooses to share their opinion on the internet (including those pajama sporting bloggers and news aggregators working out of their basements).</p>
<p>But because freedom of speech, as interpreted by Feinstein, is nothing more than a privilege granted to us by her and her ilk in Congress, she has taken steps to ensure that only those journalists sanctioned by the government will be protected by the new shield laws.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The final hurdle for the Judiciary Committee was defining who is a journalist in the digital era.</strong></p>
<p>Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) insisted on limiting the legal protection to &#8220;real reporters&#8221; and not, she said, a 17-year-old with his own website.</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>I can&#8217;t support it if everyone who has a blog has a special privilege</strong> … or if Edward Snowden were to sit down and write this stuff, he would have a privilege. I&#8217;m not going to go there,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><strong>Feinstein introduced an amendment that defines a &#8220;covered journalist&#8221; as someone who gathers and reports news for &#8220;an entity or service that disseminates news and information.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The definition includes freelancers, part-timers and student journalists, and it permits a judge to go further and extend the protections to any &#8220;legitimate news-gathering activities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As noted by Dave Hodges at <a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2013/09/25/congress-moves-to-outlaw-the-alternative-media/" target="_blank">The Common Sense Show</a>, this very report, for example, is being published by an unlicensed and unofficial news-related web site, and therefore, would not meet the stringent guidelines set forth by Feinstein&#8217;s new amendment.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the definition introduced in Feinstein’s amendment, somebody writing for a small town paper with a circulation of 30 would receive First Amendment protections, but quality news people such as Steve Quayle, John Stadtmiller, Jeff Rense, Doug Hagmann, Stan Deyo, Michael Edwards, Alex Jones, George Noory and Matt Drudge would not be considered journalists and therefore, the First Amendment would not apply to this group of aforementioned newsmen.</p>
<p>With the passage of this amendment, our sources would not be privileged and many of our sources would dry up. But Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper can take bribes from the CIA to not cover certain stories, yet Feinstein thinks they deserve protection as authentic journalists.</p></blockquote>
<p>And for those out there who don&#8217;t have a blog or web site where they share news, videos, information and criticisms of government, consider that the Feinstein amendment doesn&#8217;t refer to just web sites. It covers all internet venues. It&#8217;s not about how the information gets out there, it&#8217;s about the individual or organization disseminating it.</p>
<p><strong>So, should you choose to share an opinion in the comments section on this web site or post on your Facebook or Twitter page, you would, just as this author, fall outside of the Constitutional protections of the First Amendment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your comments, if critical of government or big business interests, would not be protected by shield laws. You see, you&#8217;re not capable of forming an opinion or citing appropriate references for your argument. To do that, you must be licensed by the State or approved by a court.</strong></p>
<p>But the government can&#8217;t do that, right?</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve already tried and failed on their first attempt, but what if this law would have passed?!</p>
<blockquote><p>John McCain previously introduced a bill that would fine bloggers up to $300,000 for “offensive statements, photos and videos posted by visitors on comment boards”.</p>
<p>If the bill would have been successful, this legislation would have marked the end for previously unrestrained opinions. Hiding behind the pretense of protecting our children, McCain’s legislation was referred to as the “Stop the Online Exploitation of Our Children Act.” The legislation demands that a Stalinist-type army of informants and spies will browse various websites looking for inappropriate internet material which might pose a threat to children. McCain’s internet army would then pass the information on to the relevant police authorities and subsequent bloggers could be fined $300,000 or have faced jail time.</p>
<p>Anyone who has participated in online comment boards is keenly aware that they are very difficult to moderate. Some articles and news events may receive thousands of comments. Yet, one oversight by the moderator, one day off from the internet, could spell doom for the financial future of a blogger. What citizen can afford to take that chance? Hence, your right to self-expression has been sacrificed. Your first amendment right to self-expression is technically still intact. However, the personal affordability to exercise free speech would have been severely jeopardized</p>
<p><em><a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2013/09/25/congress-moves-to-outlaw-the-alternative-media/" target="_blank">Common Sense Show</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>While McCain&#8217;s bill died a horrible death, and rightly so, Feinstein&#8217;s amendment essentially aims to do the same thing, though monetary fines for journalistic transgressions are as of yet undefined.</p>
<p>You see, as is always the case with our Congressional benefactors, the devil is in the details.</p>
<p>Take, for example, health care. For years the establishment pushed for universal, affordable health care for all Americans. The efforts really started back in the 1990&#8242;s with the failed Hillary-care movement. But it didn&#8217;t really die. In fact, calls for free health care got louder and louder, and in 2008 they came to a head with the election of Barack Obama, who promised just that for Americans. It took nearly 20 years, but they did it, and millions of Americans thought they had won a victory.</p>
<p>But, lo and behold, after legislation to cheapen and improve our health care was passed, we began to see the fine print come to fruition. And all those folks who vehemently supported an affordable care option are now wondering what the hell happened. As was revealed in recent days, costs aren&#8217;t going down. Just the opposite, in fact. For many Americans who rallied behind the President <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/bend-over-and-cough-some-insurance-rates-to-quadruple-with-obamas-good-deal-on-healthcare_092013" target="_blank">those costs are going to double, triple, or quadruple</a>!</p>
<p>Now they are pushing forward with new restrictions on speech. And just as no one thought they&#8217;d actually be paying more for health care after the legislation was passed, no one really believes the government would go so far as to eliminate our ability to open discourse.</p>
<p>As with Obamacare, it&#8217;s all in the details &#8211; the fine print and the complementary regulations to follow.</p>
<p>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is government double-speak for, &#8220;you&#8217;re about to get screwed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guess what Feinstein&#8217;s version of the Media Shield Law is going to do.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Ohio State University Department of Public Safety has acquired an armored military vehicle that looks like it belongs in Iraq or Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Gary Lewis, a senior director of media relations at OSU, told The Daily Caller via email that the “unique, special-purpose vehicle is a replacement” for the “police fleet.” He called the armored jalopy “an all-hazard, all-purpose, public safety-response vehicle” with “obviously enhanced capabilities.”</p>
<p>He noted that the vehicle was “acquired at no cost from Military Surplus.” He also bragged that it has “extremely low miles and is in nearly new condition” but elaborated no further concerning the acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>“We are in the process of making it usable for our needs in an urban campus environment,”</strong> Lewis explained. “Specifically we are removing the top turret and repainting.”</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The vehicle looks like an MRAP, which is the general name for an armored fighting vehicle designed to survive ambushes and improvised explosive device (IED) attacks. Lewis mentioned nothing about IEDs or ambushes in his email to TheDC.</p>
<p><strong>Instead, the school envisions a number of uses for the vehicle including “officer rescue,” “hostage scenarios,” “bomb evaluation” and active killers loose on campus.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The vehicle also boasts a “sniper perch” and it is ideal “for crew protection under threat of explosives and small arms fire.”</strong></p>

<p>According to the military, the Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicle is <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2013/09/19/ohio-state-university-gets-armored-milit" target="_blank">specifically designed</a> for asymmetric warfare.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get this straight.</p>
<p>University students and teachers are forbidden from bringing a licensed handgun onto school property for personal protection in case of a hostage situation or active killer being loose, but it makes complete sense, because of the terroristic threats we face, to put a military fighting vehicle on campus?</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s yet another desensitization effort in the grand <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/mcgrath-the-control-grid-is-being-put-into-place-to-handle-what-they-know-is-coming_04062012" target="_blank">control grid</a>.

<p>The game is rigged, the pain is coming, and we&#8217;re all about to become victims of greed and government once again.</p>
<p>Charlie McGrath of <strong><a href="http://wideawakenews.com/" target="_blank">Wide Awake News</a></strong> explains why:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you think the crisis of 2008 is over, then you&#8217;re falling right into the game plan of The Powers That Be.</p>
<p>Washington D.C., the Federal Reserve, any business analyst that can get in front of a camera&#8230; wants you to believe that any coming crisis financially is not related to 2008. It&#8217;s going to be a new event altogether. And they&#8217;re going to blame it on you&#8230; the American people.</p>
<p>If you believe that then you have been duped.</p>
<p>The crisis of 2008 never ended. It got far, far worse. We haven&#8217;t fixed any of the problems. We&#8217;ve made them more systemic. We&#8217;ve made them more powerful and more in control of this economy.</p>
<p>Out of the top 25 companies that were heavy into sub-prime mortgages&#8230; the leaders and CEO&#8217;s of these corporations, to a man and woman, are back in the lending business.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re back in the game&#8230; You would think some of these guys would be in prison; they&#8217;re not. They&#8217;re back working at this exact same thing that tanked this country in 2008.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ElMyM_nq1m8" height="360" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>As Charlie notes, these exact same people, the ones who engineered the sub-prime debacle that <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/vaporized-americans-wealth-collapses-40-over-last-three-years_06122012" target="_blank">wiped out the wealth of millions</a> of Americans, are now doing exactly what they were doing before. They&#8217;re lending money to unqualified borrowers to the tune of tens of billions of dollars because they say they, &#8220;want to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, as before, they are luring American borrowers into taking on interest-only loans that will lead to more foreclosures and defaults as soon as the payments on the those mortgages reset.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t about helping Americans. This is about money, plain and simple.</p>
<p>Will we never learn?</p>
<p>The honest answer: no.</p>
<p>There is only one way this is going to end and it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/emergency-preparedness/how-horrific-will-it-be-for-the-non-prepper_05122012" target="_blank">going to be horrific</a> for 99% of us.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>McGrath continues&#8230;</em></p>
<p>Before you think I am just sounding bitter because these wealthy people [bank leaders] managed to hold on to their money while so many people in this nation saw their standard of living fall, saw their number one investment tank, and saw their future basically be throw into the air in the form of sovereign debt, I&#8217;m not.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m telling you all this because it&#8217;s going to happen again. </strong></p>
<p>A story came out just yesterday showing that the Federal Reserve, this institution that bent over backwards to save the aforementioned individuals and institutions that they work for, now holds more debt&#8230; than was ever created in this nation from George Washington through Bill Clinton&#8230; $3.4 trillion they now own.</p>
<p>You might think that&#8217;s great. You stick them with the bill and walk away.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the way it&#8217;s going to work.</p>
<p><strong>With this holding of debt they also hold the power over this economy.</strong></p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Our leaders must understand that this private institution, that is not federal and that has no reserves, is running roughshod over this economy and they&#8217;re serving their financial special interest masters on Wall Street because that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re made up of.</p>
<p><strong>And at the end of the day when this comes crashing down they will be the ones holding all the power.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We need to realize this because this crisis is not over. A far worse crisis is yet to come.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>We live in a nation of people who <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/charlie-mcgrath/we-are-surrounded-by-a-nation-of-people-who-will-not-step-out-of-their-perceived-reality_11032012" target="_blank">will not step out of their perceived reality</a>, and they are going to pay the price for their ignorance.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/charlie-mcgrath/mcgrath-there-is-a-disaster-coming-get-ready-for-it_11132012" target="_blank">previous commentary</a> Charlie McGrath warned about the disaster that will soon come our way.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>We’re talking about the potential for an absolute credit freeze that will make the situation in New York spread across this country almost overnight.</strong></p>
<p>Ask yourself this question: Are you prepared to take care of yourself?</p>
<p>If you cannot answer that question with the affirmative it is time to stop just listening to alternative media and thinking of it as entertainment, but taking the advice seriously and considering if you have a plan to take care of yourself and loved ones if the situation arises.</p>
<p>Because if you look around this world, if you look at the mainstream media, they’re forewarning you about what’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>There is a disaster coming. Get ready for it. Make sure you are mentally and physically prepared for what is coming.</strong></p>
<p><em>From Charlie McGrath of <a href="http://www.wideawakenews.com/" target="_blank">Wide Awake News</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>When the credit markets froze in 2008, then Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson warned members of Congress that if something wasn&#8217;t done there would be tanks on the streets of America.</p>
<p>Some would laugh at that notion. But this is no conjecture.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/HaG9d_4zij8" height="360" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Guess what folks&#8230; this next go &#8217;round there will be no bail out, no saving the system, and no relief coming.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s coming is <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/mark-levin-government-is-simulating-the-collapse-of-our-financial-system-the-collapse-of-our-society-and-the-potential-for-widespread-violence_03082013" target="_blank">what the U.S. government has been simulating</a> for the last half decade: A total collapse of our financial system, civil unrest, and the very real possibility of a <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/mcgrath-the-control-grid-is-being-put-into-place-to-handle-what-they-know-is-coming_04062012" target="_blank">lock-down</a> of the United States of America in its entirety.</p>

<p>We are a nation that consumes far more wealth than we produce.  We are a nation that buys far more from the rest of the world than they buy from us.  We are a nation that has a &#8220;buy now, pay later&#8221; mentality.</p>
<p>As a nation, we have accumulated the largest mountain of debt in the history of the world.  40 years ago, the total amount of debt in our system (government, business and consumer) was about 2 trillion dollars.  Today, it is more than 56 trillion dollars.</p>
<p>The consequences of decades of incredibly foolish decisions are starting to catch up with us, and it is those at the bottom of the food chain that will suffer the most.</p>
<p>I could spend the rest of this article quoting 30 or 40 more statistics that show how bad things are, but today I wanted to do something different.  Today, I wanted to share some quotes from some of my readers about what they are seeing where they live.  The following are 20 quotes from ordinary Americans about the economic despair that is rapidly growing like a cancer all around us&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> <a title="David" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/they-denied-that-we-were-in-a-depression-in-1933-and-they-are-doing-it-again-in-2013">David</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the American economy is in the pits. I know five languages, have three degrees (including two graduate degrees), and have lived overseas for 16 years and I still can&#8217;t find a job in the USA. Everything is broken in America. Maybe I should give up my American citizenship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been struggling since I finished college in the summer of 2010. My dream is to work in the courts, law enforcement but it&#8217;s almost impossible to get a call back for an interview. I interviewed with Garland, Texas PD for a position in the city jail and I made the final 30 of 300 applicants that applied for the 3 positions.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> <a title="Akitawoman" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/percentage-of-americans-that-consider-themselves-to-be-lower-class-is-at-an-all-time-high">Akitawoman</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have two Master&#8217;s degrees, am 61 years old and earning $10 per hour. What does that say about the current economy?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> <a title="Cincinnati Dave" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/prepare-for-tough-times-if-your-job-has-anything-to-do-with-real-estate-or-mortgages">Cincinnati Dave</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;I work for one of the banks mentioned in your article. I was in mortgages. I saw all of this coming, so several months ago I asked to get into another area of the bank and fortunately, for me, they granted by request. A lot of people are losing their jobs and there is really no prospects out there for anything else whereby the same kind of money could be made. I will make nothing near what I had been earning but am at the least grateful to be employed. This is all so sad to watch happen.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> <a title="Iceman" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/prepare-for-tough-times-if-your-job-has-anything-to-do-with-real-estate-or-mortgages">Iceman</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to work for WF processing mortgages. The week that the rates went up, I was out of work, not one extra week of work.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> <a title="Tim" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/prepare-for-tough-times-if-your-job-has-anything-to-do-with-real-estate-or-mortgages">Tim</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. economy is producing mostly part-time, low-wage jobs. These jobs barely pay enough to put food on the table.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> <a title="K" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/median-household-income-has-fallen-for-five-years-in-a-row">K</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;What I am aware of, is every person I know, who had to switch jobs in the last five years took a pay cut. The smallest cut among my friends was 10%, the average was closer to 18%. No we are heading down a bad road, and we are past the point of no return.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> <a title="Makati" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/percentage-of-americans-that-consider-themselves-to-be-lower-class-is-at-an-all-time-high">Makati</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;After spending most of my life in the middle class, I now consider myself lower class due to age and income. Nothing wrong with that. I am still able to provide myself with what I need and some of my &#8216;wants&#8217;. I am like most retirees today.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> <a title="Mondobeyondo" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/44-facts-about-the-death-of-the-middle-class-that-every-american-should-know">Mondobeyondo</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;As many of you already know (but maybe some new members of this blog don&#8217;t) &#8211; I live in Phoenix, Arizona. Where you live here, determines (to a great extent) your economic well being. Those in the &#8220;East Valley&#8221; &#8211; Chandler, Gilbert, Scottsdale, etc &#8211; have the jobs, the opportunities and the transportation. Those in the wealthier areas of the &#8220;West Valley&#8221; also have these benefits.</p>
<p>The remainder &#8211; those who live in the older west side of town, and the south side of town &#8211; are mainly forgotten and left to struggle. Many are hard working citizens who just want a chance. Unfortunately, chance costs money, in the view of many people, and as far as the municipal government is concerned, there&#8217;s no money for us. It&#8217;s cheaper to let them live in a tent in the park, where the cops at least have an excuse to evict them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no middle class here in the Florida Panhandle. Only folks who have money are the retired and they hate everyone. They own all the antique stores [big business] and most thriving businesses and restuarants. Military is big here, they spend every dime they have on stupid stuff and taxis. Tourist are way down since the spill. Now for the good news. A major food chain here is going out of business [Food World] Another is losing 20k a month to theft. Every other property it seems is up for sale. There are tons of empty real estate [store fronts] There are thrift stores opening everywhere. People are selling goods on the streets, only to be run off by the cops. Crime is getting out of hand. Most don&#8217;t go out after dark. Police are beating up the homeless at the beaches. Panhandling now is mainly younger people. Where did all the older ones go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In my area which is SW Florida, it&#8217;s been getting tighter for my customers so on a case by case basis I lower my price when they need auto repairs. I still find road signs advertising homes for sale (cash only). Many are advertised as foreclosed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started seeing people living out of their cars. It&#8217;s not a daily occurrence but I have been noticing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have been looking after the homeless now for 4 years. Last winter I had an encounter where I was told that I could not hand out blankets and sleeping bags in the dead of winter and that I would be arrested for trespassing if &#8220;me and my friends&#8221; didn&#8217;t move along.</p>
<p>So, I adopted the policy that I would pull up next to them, have them get in the car and we would go for a drive. I would find a place to pull over and give them what they needed then I would drop them off in a different place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Around where I live in the SE, things seem ok but I live in a university town. Go to some of the surrounding small towns and it is desolate. Car dealerships closed. Entire streets with abandoned stores. The only activity is a one clerk post office. I know people in our church who are a paycheck away from going over the edge or going over due to a spouse dying and losing one of their social security checks. I see grim. More homeless. A local church is feeding many more including some folks living out of their cars&#8212;lots of children. Mostly minimum wage jobs in the area. If it were not for the university and its 34,000 students, this place would look as bad as the smaller communities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here in southeast TN we have jobs, mostly part-time or low wage. Our problem these days are so many people dependent on government programs no one wants to work. They do better on programs than working partying and paying for insurance. Housing still very depressed. Seeing more homeless around and local churches straining to provide food. Crime is up and drugs, which were down, are coming back with a vengeance. Middle class here are senior citizens on SS, younger retirees not the older ones. Older ones seem to be struggling. Sad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Michael, I live in North Central Illinois. About 60 miles southeast of Chicago. The town we live in has about 8,000 in it. Very &#8220;middle class&#8221; farm community. Unemployment is high and so is underemployment. We know many people living off 2 part time jobs. That seems to be the norm around here. Or people taking jobs that they would never of considered in the past, just to get by. My son used to work for CAT in Aurora, but was &#8220;let go&#8221; in order to bring in new workers at a lower pay scale. It took him over a year(which really isn&#8217;t bad) to find a part time job with 3M.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drive around Los Angeles at 3:00 AM any day and you will see the devastating and pervasive homelessness from 8 to 80 year olds.  And the massage parlors and hookers on the streets of used to be &#8216;high-end&#8217; neighborhoods are exploding. No other way to make a living.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A couple of years ago it was reported 9K people a night slept in their cars here in San Diego County. Special car parks are set up in some church parking lots. The cops look the other way. Wonder what the figure is now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;During a conversation on prepping, someone recently said to me, &#8216;If things get half as bad as these preppers think they will, I don&#8217;t want to be alive.&#8217; So, how bad will things will get? Real unemployment is already at Great Depression levels (John Williams&#8217; Shadow Statistics contradicts the BLS&#8217; bogus figures), but when this depression deepens, I think we&#8217;ll be looking at 50% or 60% unemployment easily. Much worse than the 1930s. It will be absolute hell for millions of Americans, and when the money stops flowing down to the man on the street, the blood will flow in the streets (Gerald Celente). Lots of it.&#8221;</p>

<em><small>(Punishable Offense: Khalid Caraballo demonstrates shooting an airsoft toy pistol in his front yard)</small></em></p>
<p>The madness of the government indoctrination machine is no longer limited to school grounds.</p>
<p>With children and teens across the country being regularly suspended for playing with <a href="http://www.infowars.com/9-year-old-suspended-indefinitely-from-school-toy-that-looks-like-a-gun/" target="_blank">toys that resemble guns</a> or even wearing <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/more-bureaucratic-hysteria-virginia-student-sent-home-for-wearing-duck-dynasty-t-shirt-that-implies-violence_092013" target="_blank">t-shirts that are suggestive</a> of rebellious or violent behavior, it only makes sense that school officials would threaten students who go against school policies in the privacy of their homes and yards with expulsion.</p>
<p>Not possible you say, because a student&#8217;s home is protected by private property rights and is outside of the jurisdiction of any school board or regulation?</p>
<p>In the new America, anything is possible. In fact, given the extent to which the government has expanded their surveillance and regulatory network, it&#8217;s not only possible, but highly probable.</p>
<p>Case in point.</p>
<p>According to WAVY TV, a Virginia Beach public school has suspended several students for &#8220;possession, handling and use of a firearm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Except that the firearms in question are, of course, air propelled plastic pellet guns available for purchase at any local sporting goods store throughout America.</p>
<p>You may also notice that the &#8220;firearm&#8221; (pictured above &#8211; we&#8217;re surprised they didn&#8217;t refer to it as an &#8220;assault firearm&#8221;) is a toy, as designated by the orange marker at the tip of its barrel.</p>
<p>And, most importantly, the &#8220;students&#8221; weren&#8217;t actually acting in the capacity of students because they weren&#8217;t at school. That&#8217;s right,<strong> these boys were at home, in their own front yard. </strong></p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.infowars.com/seventh-graders-suspended-for-nine-months-for-playing-with-toy-gun-at-home/" target="_blank">noted by Steven Watson</a>, a highly alert and hypersensitive neighbor who saw something quickly dialed 9-1-1 to say something:</p>
<blockquote><p>A neighbor saw them and called in a complaint to police. The caller even acknowledged that the gun wasn’t real, telling the 911 dispatcher “This is not a real one, but it makes people uncomfortable. I know that it makes me (uncomfortable), as a mom, to see a boy pointing a gun.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Report by <a href="http://www.myfoxphilly.com/story/23515547/two-kids-may-be-expelled-for-firing-airsoft-guns" target="_blank">My Fox Philly</a> (Video below):</p>
<blockquote><p>A mother in Virginia Beach is outraged that the city public school system suspended her twelve-year-old son and his friend because they were firing a spring-driven airsoft gun on her family&#8217;s private property.</p>
<p>Solangel Caraballo says that the two boys may even be expelled and not allowed to return to the school for at least a year.</p>
<p>The trouble began two weeks ago when a neighbor called 911 to report seeing 12-year-old Khalid Caraballo using the airsoft gun for target-shooting in his yard. The airsoft guns use plastic pellets.</p>
<p>Right around that time, Khalid said he and his friend shot some other friends during &#8220;an airsoft gun war,&#8221; but says the two boys who were shot weren&#8217;t hurt.</p>
<p>The school district says that an investigation found the children were firing pellet guns at each other and at people near the bus stop. Khalid denies they were near the bus stop.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were in our yard. This had nothing to do with school. I didn&#8217;t have anything of this at school. Anytime,&#8221; said Khalid.</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: left;">Somebody needs to contact World Citizen Henry Porter at the London Observer to report this travesty. Perhaps he can <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/world-citizen-asks-united-nations-to-disarm-america-the-world-cannot-stand-idly-by_09232013" target="_blank">convince the United Nations to assemble a military force</a> to disarm the middle schoolers in this country of their right to bear toys.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since when is it OK for a government organization, or a quasi-government organization funded by tax payer dollars, to interfere with the private lives of individual American citizens?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Or is that how we&#8217;re doing things now in the land of the free?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(Pictured: Henry Porter, World Citizen)</em></p>
<p>In his latest article, London Observer writer Henry Porter denigrates American gun owners by calling us insane and requests the assistance of the United Nations to &#8220;disarm the irrational rustics.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a sentiment shared by many world citizens, as well as about 52% of Americans who participated in a recent <a href="http://www.infowars.com/huffpo-poll-shows-support-for-second-amendment/" target="_blank">Huffington Post poll</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Via <a href="http://www.infowars.com/huffpo-poll-shows-support-for-second-amendment/" target="_blank">Kurt Nimmo of Infowars</a>:</em></p>
<p>Outside of the United States, where the idea of self-ownership and the natural right of self-defense is at best a dismal concept, members of the corporatized media are calling for armed intervention to put an end to the Second Amendment.</p>
<p>“But what if we no longer thought of this as just a problem for America and, instead, viewed it as an international humanitarian crisis – a quasi civil war, if you like, that calls for outside intervention?” writes <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/21/american-gun-out-control-porter" target="_blank">Henry Porter</a> of the London Observer. “As citizens of the world, perhaps we should demand an end to the unimaginable suffering of victims and their families – the maiming and killing of children – just as America does in every new civil conflict around the globe.”</p>
<p>Mr. Porter proudly notes that Britons long ago dispensed with English Common Law – apparently including its precedent, the Magna Carta – and insists that the right to bear arms is an antiquated idea akin to holding slaves.</p>
<p><strong>“Half the country is sane and rational while the other half simply doesn’t grasp the inconsistencies and historic lunacy of its position, which springs from the second amendment right to keep and bear arms, and is derived from English common law and our 1689 Bill of Rights,” he writes. “We dispensed with these rights long ago, but American gun owners cleave to them with the tenacity that previous generations fought to continue slavery.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maybe the United Nations can be sent in to disarm the irrational rustics. “This has reached the point where it has ceased to be a domestic issue. The world cannot stand idly by.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>If Mr. Porter had it his way he&#8217;d deploy a United Nations force of <strong>armed military personnel</strong> to the United States for the sole purpose of <strong>disarming law abiding Americans</strong>.</p>
<p>What Mr. Porter apparently doesn&#8217;t understand is that the Second Amendment is the very backstop for people like him, who would violate the natural laws of self preservation and property rights by use of force.</p>
<p>Rather than claiming that we fight for our right to bear arms with the tenacity of slave owners, I like to think we fight for this right with the same tenacity that we fought British imperial rule in the late 1700&#8242;s. But Mr. Porter didn&#8217;t want to make that analogy, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Mr. Porter, I will be the very first American to surrender my weapon to you&#8230; from my cold dead heads.</p>
<p>My good friend and Army veteran Ed Thomas who has spent many months in a war zone, and who is also the editor of <strong><a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/" target="_blank">The Daily Sheeple</a></strong>, has a similar message, and one he recently tattooed on his arm expressly for the purpose of informing people like Mr. Porter and other world citizens who have any skewed ideas about how easy such a gun grab might be:</p>

<p> Come and Take It, Mr. Porter.</p>

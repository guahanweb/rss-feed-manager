<p>When you think of that little dream homestead in the woods, what does it include?  Probably a well and septic system, a little stream bubbling nearby, a chicken coop, a sunroom for winter growing, and a cozy fire to curl up next to.</p>
<p>When my daughter and I spent a year <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/lessons-from-a-northern-cabin-06152013" target="_blank">living in a cabin in the Northwoods of Canada</a>, our woodstove was our lifeline. It was the only source of heat in a place that reached -42 degrees.  It was the only way we could cook when our power went out during snow and ice storms (as it did frequently).  It was the cozy center of our home, and we survived for an entire frigid winter for less than$800. After that experience I vowed never to live in a home without a woodstove.</p>
<p>If the EPA has its way, however, heating your home self-sufficiently with wood could soon become illegal &#8211; or at the very least, insanely expensive.</p>
<p><a href="http://offgridsurvival.com/epa-woodburningstoves-illegal/" target="_blank">Off Grid Surviva</a>l reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shortly after the re-election of President Obama, the agency announced new radical environmental regulations that threaten to effect people who live off the grid. The EPA’s new environmental regulations reduce the amount of airborne fine-particle matter from 15 micrograms to 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air.</p>
<p>This means that most wood burning stoves would now fall into a class that would deemed unacceptable under these new draconian measures. The EPA has even launched a nifty new website called <a href="http://www.epa.gov/burnwise/">Burn Wise</a> to try to sway public opinion.</p>
<p>On their site, while trying to convince people to get rid of their old stoves and buy the new EPA-certified stoves, they state that these older stove must be scrapped and cannot be resold.</p>
<p><strong>From the EPA Site:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The local air pollution agency says I can’t sell my old wood stove to help pay for an EPA-certified wood stove.  Why is that?</strong><br />
Replacing an older stove with a cleaner-burning stove will not improve air quality if the older stove is reused somewhere else.  For this reason, wood stove change out programs usually require older stoves to be destroyed and recycled as scrap metal, or rendered inoperable. (<a href="http://offgridsurvival.com/epa-woodburningstoves-illegal/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>And here is the information right from <a href="http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/publications/monitoring/caa/woodstoves/certifiedwood.pdf" target="_blank">the EPA</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Enclosed is the list of wood stoves certified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA Certified Wood Stoveslist contains information about wood stoves or wood heating appliances that have been certified by the EPA along with its manufacturer name, model name, emission rate (g/hr), heat output (btu/hr), efficiency (actual measured and estimated), and type of appliance. It also indicates whether the appliance is still being manufactured. An EPA certified wood stove or wood heating appliance has been independently tested by an accredited laboratory to determine whether it meets the particulate emissions limit of 7.5* grams per hour for noncatalytic wood stoves and 4.1* grams per hour for catalytic wood stoves. All wood heating appliances that are offered for sale in the United States are subject to the New Source Performance Standard for New Residential Wood Heaters under the Clean Air Act and are required to meet these emission limits. An EPA certified wood stove can be identified by a temporary paper label attached to the front of the wood stove and a permanent metal label affixed to the back or side of the wood stove.</p></blockquote>
<p>See the EPA&#8217;s list of acceptable woodstoves <a href="http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/publications/monitoring/caa/woodstoves/certifiedwood.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways for the government to force this issue is through homeowner&#8217;s insurance policies. If you have a mortgage, you have absolutely no option but to carry homeowner&#8217;s insurance.  Even if you own you homestead outright, most people consider insuring their homes and property to be a vital safety net. When your policy comes up for annual renewal, the insurance company can require an inspection of your home. At that time, compliance can easily be forced by either charging insanely high rates or through the cancellation of the policies of those who have &#8220;outdated&#8221; woodstoves.</p>
<h2>An Attack on Self-Sufficient Living</h2>
<p>The ability to heat your home off-grid is a major part of most preparedness plans.  Heating with wood is the number one way to do this.  Much like<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/how-many-buckets-of-freedom-do-you-have-02252013" target="_blank"> our food supplies</a>, the ability to keep ourselves warm and healthy and the ability to cook without being connected to the grid are vital to our freedom.</p>
<p>Those of us who live this lifestyle are constantly targeted. In many places it&#8217;s illegal to collect rainwater.  Growing food in your front yard instead of flowers is all but outlawed.  Sellers of raw milk have their farms raided by SWAT teams as though they&#8217;re running a meth lab instead of a dairy. We are being <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/codex-alimentarius-an-introduction-to-soft-kill-eugenics-2-12102012" target="_blank">Codex Alimentarius-ed</a> and Agenda 21-ed right into slavery and the government and it&#8217;s agencies try to make it appear that they are &#8220;saving&#8221; us.</p>
<p>We, the self-sufficient, by our very nature, are a threat to this insidiously spreading control. Our self-sufficiency means that we won&#8217;t be forced to be subjugated, tagged, chipped, and inventoried like our less prepared friends and neighbors.  We won&#8217;t have to cave in order to survive. We can eat, stay warm, and stay off the radar.  And this is a threat because we can withstand the assaults on our freedom.  We don&#8217;t need<a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/watch-american-dependency-give-me-my-food-stamps_09202013" target="_blank"> the government&#8217;s benevolence to survive</a>. Those of us who don&#8217;t need the government are the last hold-outs of liberty in a country that has strayed far from it&#8217;s freedom-loving origins.</p>
<h2>The &#8220;Credibility&#8221; of the EPA</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t be fooled by environmental friendliness or the warm and fuzzy green words.  The EPA is just another tool of subjugation.  Their stamp of approval carries the same &#8220;credibility&#8221; as that of  USDA or FDA approval. The Environmental Protection Agency, that bastion of clean air and fertile land, wants you to believe that they are taking steps to save us all.</p>
<p>You know, the same folks who <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/despite-irrefutable-evidence-of-toxicity-and-death-monsantos-friends-at-the-epa-raise-allowable-glysophate-levels-06192013" target="_blank">upped the legal levels of glyphosate for their friends at Monsanto</a>, even though the herbicide has been proven to cause toxicity and death. The same <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/pardon-me-your-food-is-glowing-04122012" target="_blank">agency that responded quickly when radiation</a> from the Fukushima disaster reached dangerous levels on the shores of California by closing down 8 of their 18 radiation-testing facilities in California and increasing the “safe amounts” of radiation that we can absorb.</p>
<p>The EPA (or as I like to call it, the <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/the-environmental-deception-agency-04152012" target="_blank">Environmental Deception Agency</a>) tends to  find things to be highly threatening to the environment only when those things allow us to be non-reliant on big business.</p>
<p>One controversy after another can be attributed to the EPA, an agency charged with protecting the air we breathe, the soil in which we grow our food and the water that we drink.  At the bottom of each of those controversies can be found ties to the conspiracies of the big businesses that really run the country.  Decisions are being auctioned off to industry lobbyists with the most money and influence.</p>
<p>Environmental protection is only the rule of thumb if it goes along with <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/agenda-21-full-spectrum-domination-02282012" target="_blank">Agenda 21</a> – the EPA is all over <a href="http://www.epa.gov/owow/NPS/ordinance/mol3.htm">the green agenda</a> in cases that benefit the redistribution of wealth, but the agency completely ignores blatant crimes against the earth if it involves fracking for the benefit of a natural gas company or poisoning the soil and groundwater for the benefit of a biotech monolith.</p>

<h3><em>Want $10 off your bill at the grocery store?  Stop by our pharmacy and let us jab a needle full of toxins into your arm!</em></h3>
<h3><em>Want to avoid killing off your newborn, your elderly neighbor, and some random unvaccinated cancer patient?  Do your part by getting stabbed!</em></h3>
<h3><em>Want to circumvent potential death by influenza?  Just get your flu shot at any of our convenient walk-in locations.</em></h3>
<h3><em>Want to keep your job?  Get your mandatory flu shot or your fired &#8211; but don&#8217;t worry &#8211; it&#8217;s FREE!</em></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s that time of year again.  The propaganda machine is in high gear, churning out the fear in order to get everyone lined up for their annual flu shots.   Widely trusted websites like the<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm" target="_blank"> CDC</a>, <a href="http://www.flu.gov/prevention-vaccination/vaccination/" target="_blank">Flu.gov</a>, and the<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/flu-shots/ID00017" target="_blank"> Mayo Clinic </a>are all trumpeting the necessity of this year&#8217;s vaccination and proclaiming it to be the best way to stay healthy.</p>
<p>The CDC (Center for Disease Control) held a press conference yesterday (Sept. 26, 2013) in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nfid.org/">National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID)</a> to kick off this year&#8217;s vaccine push.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our message today is simple,&#8221; Dr. Howard Koh, assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. &#8220;Everyone 6 months of age and older should receive a flu vaccine.</p>
<p>The good news, according to the government health agency, is that more kids and health care workers got vaccinated during last year&#8217;s flu season, compared to previous years. That&#8217;s key, because children and people with preexisting health conditions are at higher risk for more serious cases of flu.</p>
<p>But, those positive trends are not going to put the brakes on the CDC&#8217;s efforts to tout the vaccines, especially among some high-risk groups still lagging in coverage rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite substantial progress, we can do even more to make our country healthier through prevention,&#8221; said Koh. &#8220;We must do everything possible now to be prepared.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-204_162-57604776/cdc-flu-vaccination-rates-lagging-in-pregnant-women-nursing-home-employees/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>This year the focus is on pregnant women and people who are employed at long term health care facilities.  Don&#8217;t be surprised to see another rash of &#8220;get your flu shot or lose your job&#8221; ultimatums for nursing home workers.  Last year, workplaces, schools and other activities across the US and Canada instituted policies that forced all participants to receive a flu shot. <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/01/several-nurses-fired-for-refusing-toxic.html" target="_blank">Longterm hospital employees were fired</a> for refusing to have the toxin injected into themselves.  Children were banned from pre-schools and daycares in 6 states.  Nursing students were told to have the shot or lose their placements, thus disqualifying them for their degrees. The media and government launched a full-out propaganda assault to force those who didn&#8217;t want it to have the flu shot anyway, at risk of their livelihoods and educations.</p>
<p>What the propagandists and flu shot proponents fail to mention are the horror stories &#8211; like the fact that 23 senior citizens (in that touted high-risk-must-get-a-shot group) just DIED from the same flu shots that are given at local pharmacies, with no accountability, no prescription necessary, and no check up from the doctor. (But you DO get a handy 20% off shopping pass when you get your flu shot!)</p>
<blockquote><p>Package inserts for flu vaccines show a multitude of side effects, including death, and yet they are marketed the same as over-the-counter drugs with no prescription needed. Why?</p>
<p>Because in the United States vaccines enjoy complete immunity from lawsuits in the market place. If you are injured or die from a vaccine, you or your family cannot sue the manufacturer of the vaccine. This law enacted by Congress, was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011.</p>
<p>Therefore, they are marketed with the same marketing techniques as any other high-profit product. With the baby boomer generation moving into their senior years, today’s seniors are seen as an especially lucrative market. (<a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2013/23-seniors-died-after-receiving-this-years-flu-shot-sold-by-pharmacies/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Flu shots mean big money to the pharmacies, to the doctors, and to the drug companies.  The frenzy with which the flu shot is promoted is directly proportionate to the profit margin, but those lining their pockets fail to mention that you could be <em>paying them</em> to give you and your family a lethal injection.</p>
<h2>Why I Won&#8217;t Get a Flu Shot</h2>
<p>My first thought when the government absolutely insists that I do something is, &#8220;Heck no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Call me a conspiracy theorist if you want to &#8211; I&#8217;m cool with that &#8211; but the insistence of the powers that be that my family and I be injected with foreign substances that have not been proven to be effective and that have mild to severe side effects makes me plain suspicious.</p>
<p>My family and I will not be getting a flu shot this year (or any other year) for 5 reasons.  (Check out last year&#8217;s article, <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/five-reasons-why-ill-never-get-a-flu-shot-01122013" target="_blank">5 Reasons Why I&#8217;ll Never Get a Flu Shot</a>, for more details on each of these reasons.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/037323_flu_vaccines_junk_science_toxicity.html" target="_blank">doesn&#8217;t work</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>There are horrible toxic ingredients in the vaccine.</strong></li>
<li><strong>There is a risk of mild to horrific side effects.</strong></li>
<li><strong>I don&#8217;t trust the <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/the-sinister-corporate-agenda-of-the-fda-04142012" target="_blank">FDA</a>, the CDC, or the AMA &#8211; they work for the benefit of the government and Big Business &#8211; not for the benefit of the public.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If the mainstream media is constantly endorsing it, I refuse to participate because they are known propagandists and mouthpieces for advertisers and political agendas.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Just like with any other sales pitch, the more insistent the salesman and the less information they want to give you about the product, the faster you should run the other direction.</p>
<h2>But&#8230;Isn&#8217;t the Shot the Best Way to Prevent Catching the Flu?</h2>
<p>You will hear in about 10,971 variations that &#8220;The best way to prevent catching the flu is to receive your annual flu shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is actually untrue.</p>
<p><strong>The absolute, number one way to avoid catching the flu is through the exercise of good personal hygiene.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Wash your hands frequently when you are out.</li>
<li>Use a paper towel to open bathroom doors and turn on taps.</li>
<li>Although I&#8217;m normally not a big fan of hand sanitizer, use it during the height of flu season if you have to touch things that everyone else has been touching, like the handle of the shopping cart, door knobs, and debit machines.</li>
<li>Use antibacterial wipes (or at least baby wipes) to wash your hands and wipe the steering wheel when you get back into your vehicle.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your face &#8211; this welcomes germs that are on your hands into your body.</li>
<li>During the height of flu season, consider taking a quick shower and changing clothes when you return home, particularly if you have been in a germ-ridden place like a doctor&#8217;s office or pharmacy.</li>
<li>Make sure the kids change clothes and  thoroughly wash their hands when they return home from school.</li>
<li>I shouldn&#8217;t really have to say this, but&#8230;.wash your hands after using the bathroom and before preparing or eating food.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If your local area is being hit hard by the flu, practice avoidance to keep your family healthy</strong>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">9.  Stay home as much as possible. (Obviously, if you have work and school outside the home, this become more difficult, but avoid malls, movie theaters, and sporting events for the duration of the epidemic.)<br />
10.  Stay away from sick people if you can.<br />
11.  Avoid eating at restaurants &#8211; you don&#8217;t know the health or hygiene habits of the kitchen staff.</p>
<p><strong>If someone in your family is sick, try to minimize the spread of the illness.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">12.  If you or a family member are sick, stay home from work or school to prevent passing it on to others.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">13.  If a family member is sick, keep them isolated away from the rest of the family.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">14.  Use antibacterial wipes to clean surfaces that the sick person touches &#8211; doorknobs, TV remotes, keyboards, toilet handles, and phones.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">15. Immediate place dishes and flatware used by the sick person into hot, soapy dishwater with a drop of bleach in it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">16.  Teach children to cough into the crook of their arm instead of covering their mouth with their hands.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">17.  Have the sick person wash their hands frequently with soap and water to help prevent spreading germs through physical contact. If soap and water is unavailable, have them use hand sanitizer.</p>
<p><strong>Some other ways to stay healthy are to use natural strategies to maximize your immune system.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">18.  Drink lots of water to keep your system hydrated and efficient.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">19.  Take a high quality, organic multi-vitamin.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">20.  Take at least 3000 IUs of <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/12/14/study-shows-vitamin-d-cuts-flu-by-nearly-50.aspx" target="_blank">Vitamin D3 daily</a> - research has shown a link between a <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/2008/10/donald-w-miller-jr-md/dont-get-a-flu-shot-2/" target="_blank">Vitamin D deficit and susceptibility</a> to the flu.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">21.  Eat lots of fruits and vegetables (preferably organic and pesticide free).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">22.  Get 7-9 hours of sleep per day &#8211; a tired body has a weaker immunity against viruses.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">23.  Don&#8217;t smoke &#8211; this weakens your resistance against respiratory illnesses and worsens the effect on your body if you do become ill.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">24.  Avoid or limit alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">25.  Avoid or limit processed foods.</p>
<h2>Should You Head to the Pharmacy If You Get the Flu?</h2>
<p>If, despite all of your precautions, you do get sick, you don&#8217;t have to resort to over-the-counter remedies and prescription antivirals.  These can have horrendous side effects and are rarely effective.</p>
<p>Check out<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/avoid-the-pharmacy-fight-the-flu-with-remedies-from-the-kitchen-01092013" target="_blank"> this article</a> to learn more about the treatments from the pharmacy and discover some effective remedies that are as close as your kitchen.</p>
<p>As well, consider investing in <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/elderberry-extract-natures-tamiflu-01212013" target="_blank">nature&#8217;s version of Tamiflu &#8211; elderberry extract</a>.  Scientists have isolated the active compound in the elderberry.  It is called Antivirin and is found in proteins of the black elderberry.  The compound prevents the flu virus from invading the membranes of  healthy cells.</p>
<p>If you are sick, increase your levels of Vitamin D3 to medicinal level doses &#8211; it has been proven to reduce the time and severity of flu symptoms &#8211; learn more about this <a href="http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/newsletter/newsletter-h1n1-flu-and-vitamin-d/" target="_blank">treatment option from the Vitamin D Council</a> (the information on Vitamin D is great but sadly the article contains flu shot and Tamiflu propaganda &#8211; so, take the beneficial information and mentally set aside the rest.)</p>
<p>The worst case scenario is that you do, indeed, contract the flu. Despite the hullabaloo, you are probably not going to die, be hospitalized, or suffer horrific permanent damage from a bout of the flu. People get sick, but death from the seasonal flu is rare.  This manufactured panic over flu prevention is agenda-based.  Big Pharma wants money and Big Government wants control.</p>
<p>I don’t believe that all health care professionals and flu-shot advocates have ill-intent.  I think that many of them have just sipped the mainstream media Kool-aid – the tale-spinners of Big Pharma have slipped in just enough truth to make their theories believable.  Most people are deep-down decent and have difficulty believing that such a perverse money/power agenda could exist.</p>
<p>I’ll take the risk of illness that my healthy immune system can fight off over the risk of being forcibly inoculated with whatever toxins the creators of these vaccines choose to include.  I’ll use my little arsenal of <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/avoid-the-pharmacy-fight-the-flu-with-remedies-from-the-kitchen-01092013" target="_blank">home remedies</a> and come through it without the risk of long-term side effects that have yet to be discovered (or at least, have yet to be made public).</p>

<p>As of September 30th, the so-called Monsanto Protection Act will be dead.  This is a major victory for anti-GMO activists as it is the first time that Congress has decided in favor of the constituents as opposed to companies like Monsanto, Sygenta, Bayer, and Dow.</p>
<blockquote><p>“That provision will be gone,” said Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), confirming the change to POLITICO. The Center for Food Safety, a Washington-based non-profit, welcomed the decision as “a major victory for the food movement” and “sea change in a political climate that all too often allows corporate earmarks to slide through must-pass legislation.”</p>
<p>“Short-term appropriations bills are not an excuse for Congress to grandfather in bad policy,” said Colin O’Neil, director of government affairs for the Center. (<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/senate-continuing-resolution-monsanto-rider-97301.html" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>The Monsanto Protection Act was passed last spring as a rider sneakily put into place by <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/sen-roy-blunt-monsantos-congressional-judas-03282013" target="_blank">Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri</a> (Monsanto&#8217;s home base, incidentally.) It was passed by both the House and the Senate (see who voted for it <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/monsantos-congressional-cartel-senators-betray-constituents-in-favor-of-biotech-dollars-05282013" target="_blank">HERE</a>) , and then signed into law in a final <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/obama-betrays-americans-again-with-the-monsanto-protection-act-03272013" target="_blank">act of betrayal by President Barack Obama</a>, despite public outcry that the rider made the biotech industry untouchable and not subject to legal action regardless of the damage caused.</p>
<blockquote><p>The biotech rider <i>“could override any court-mandated caution and could instead allow continued planting.  Further, it forces USDA to approve permits for such continued planting immediately, putting industry completely in charge by allowing for a ‘back door approval’ mechanism,”</i> the Center for Food Safety said earlier this month upon news the House was reviving the measure. (<a href="http://rt.com/usa/monsanto-protection-senate-budget-303/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>As the rider is due to expire at the end of this month, a renewal of the policy was written in and<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/untouchable-government-gives-monsanto-the-go-ahead-to-kill-you-and-your-family-09162013" target="_blank"> passed by the House last week</a>, slipped into an important bill related to the federal budget, the FY14 Continuing Resolution (CR) spending bill.</p>
<blockquote><p>Monsanto and its allies have argued that what the company sought was no more than what some federal courts have done themselves in the past: Allow farmers to continue to use GMO seed –under environmental guidelines—while the court review continues.</p>
<p>Monsanto successfully expanded support among farm groups also interested in some such stewardship program. But the language itself was unusually strong in that it directed Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in no uncertain terms about how he should respond in future court cases impacting GMO seeds.</p>
<p>The secretary “shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law… immediately grant” temporary permits to continue using the seed at the request of a farmer or producer wanting such a stewardship program, the provision reads. And while Vilsack has been a big champion of the biotech industry, he was uncomfortable with what he saw as an effort to “pre-empt judicial review.”</p>
<p>“We have all known this rider’s days were numbered,” O’Neil told POLITICO. “But given the recent GMO contamination episodes of wheat and alfalfa in Oregon and Washington it is clear that our nation’s safeguards, in particular those of the federal courts, should not be under attack from policy riders like this.”  (<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/senate-continuing-resolution-monsanto-rider-97301.html" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>This proves that by keeping a close watch on what our members of Congress are doing, and by holding them publically accountable, we can affect changes.  If we keep our momentum going, Big Biotech can be defeated.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t been in a bubble cut off from all forms of media lately, it would be impossible to have missed all of the warnings being issued about the impending loss of our electrical grid.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just coming from so-called &#8220;gloom and doom&#8221; sites or from alternative media.  Major mainstream media sources such as ABC News, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and CBS News have all issued the alerts. Unfortunately, the hordes seem to be brushing these warnings off as something that cannot happen, because the reality is too unpleasant to even contemplate.  Many seem to think that they are far better to stick their heads in the sand and be assured it can never happen than to prepare ahead of time.</p>
<h2>Who Is Ringing the Warning Bell?</h2>
<p>In case you&#8217;ve missed it, here are some of the warnings over the past few months that most people are ignoring.</p>
<p>When Janet Napolitano stepped down from her role as head of the DHS she released an open letter to her successor.  One chilling tidbit she passed on was this.</p>
<blockquote><p>The outgoing Homeland Security Secretary has a warning for her successor: A massive and “serious” cyber attack on the U.S. homeland is coming, and a natural disaster — the likes of which the nation has never seen — is also likely on its way. (<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/08/outgoing-dhs-secretary-janet-napolitano-warns-of-serious-cyber-attackunprecedented-natural-disaster/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Read more on Napolitano&#8217;s warning <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/big-sis-says-cyber-attack-will-bring-down-power-grid-when-not-if/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/J2HPvQ6P5yE" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more.  Big Sis isn&#8217;t the only one warning us about the possibility of a grid-down scenario.</p>
<p>Former North Dakota Senator Byron Dorgan has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/us/imagining-a-cyberattack-on-the-power-grid.html?_r=0" target="_blank">co-authored a book about the topic</a> with David Hagberg &#8211; his novel Gridlock is a fictional account of a very real threat.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our power system is very vulnerable. You could see a shutdown by hackers in cyber terror. You could see it shutdown for days, weeks or months, crippling this country and causing enormous havoc.” (<a href="http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/07/14/author-hopes-to-spread-awareness-of-power-grid-security-risks/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) also actively agrees with the threat assessment.  He released a report last May that said our power infrastructure was &#8220;highly vulnerable to attacks from Iran and North Korea” and as well as to natural threats such as geomagnetic storms from solar activity.</p>
<blockquote><p>“With one well-placed keystroke, Americans could be plunged into darkness and chaos through the damage to our electric grid. Foreign enemies are employing Web warriors to attack our way of life, and it’s time that our actions respond to the potential threat.” (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/05/22/house-democrats-report-says-power-grid-vulnerable-to-cyber-attacks/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Other people in the know have attempted to make the public aware of the potential for apocalyptic disaster, but few seem to be taking them seriously.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>We are only one act of madness away from a social cataclysm unlike anything our country has ever known.</strong><br />
<em>-Congressman Trent Franks (R-AZ), Senior Member House Armed Service Committee</em></p>
<p><strong>EMP is one of the small number of threats that could hold at risk the continued existence of U.S. civil society.</strong><br />
<em>-Dr. Robert Hermann, Commissioner US Congress EMP Commission</em></p>
<p><strong>Just one violent active region on the sun can cause continent-wide, perhaps even planetary-scale impacts to our critical infrastructure.</strong><br />
<em>-John Kappenman, Principal Investigator US Congress EMP Commission</em></p>
<p><strong>The Likelihood of a severe geo-magnetic event capable of crippling our electric grid is 100%.</strong><br />
<em>-Congresswoman Yvette Clarke (D-NY), Senior Member House Homeland Security Committee</em></p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/congresswoman-the-likelihood-of-a-severe-geo-magnetic-event-capable-of-crippling-our-electric-grid-is-100_09032013" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Former Congressman <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vtjq-owGjPg" target="_blank">Roscoe Bartlett has been preaching</a> the dangers of EMP, whether deliberate or natural, for many years:</p>
<blockquote><p>We could have events in the future where the power grid will go down and it’s not, in any reasonable time, coming back up. For instance, if when the power grid went down some of our large transformers were destroyed, damaged beyond use, we don’t make any of those in this country. They’re made overseas and you order one and 18 months to two years later they will deliver it. Our power grid is very vulnerable. It’s very much on edge. Our military knows that.</p>
<p>There are a number of events that could create a situation in the cities where civil unrest would be a very high probability.</p>
<p><strong>I think that those who can, and those who understand, need to take advantage of the opportunity when these winds of strife are not blowing to move their families out of the city. </strong>(<a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/congresswoman-the-likelihood-of-a-severe-geo-magnetic-event-capable-of-crippling-our-electric-grid-is-100_09032013" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget the veiled warnings implicit in predictive programming entertainment.  One of last year&#8217;s biggest television hits was the show &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Revolution</a>&#8220;, which portrayed life 15 years after a deliberate takedown of the power grid.</p>
<h2>GridEx Drill in November</h2>
<p>And finally, if all of these warnings aren&#8217;t enough to alert your Spidey senses, here is one that is undeniable.</p>
<p>The United States, Mexico, and Canada intend to participate in a drill in November that will simulate the takedown of the grid.</p>
<blockquote><p>An electrical grid joint drill simulation is being planned in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Thousands of utility workers, FBI agents, anti-terrorism experts, governmental agencies, and more than 150 private businesses are involved in the November <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/us/as-worries-over-the-power-grid-rise-a-drill-will-simulate-a-knockout-blow.html?_r=0" target="_blank">power grid drill</a>.</p>
<p>The downed <a href="http://www.offthegridnews.com/2013/08/13/new-power-grid-report-card-reveal-dangerous-vulnerabilities/" target="_blank">power grid</a> simulation will reportedly focus on both physical and cyber attacks. The antiquated electrical system in the United States has been one of the most neglected pieces of integral infrastructure.</p>
<p>The disaster drill is being described as a crisis practice unlike anything the real power grid has ever experienced. The <a href="http://www.spp.org/publications/13%20-%20CIPC%20Brief%20%28Harrell%20Conway%20Mar%202013%29%20V2.pdf" target="_blank">GridEX II</a> drill Nov. 13-14 will focus primarily on how governments will react if the electrical grid fails and, for instance, the food supply chain collapses.</p>
<p>American utility companies are responsible for running approximately 5,800 power plants and about 450,000 high-voltage transmission lines, controlled by various devices which have been put into place over the past decades. Some of the utility companies which oversee the power grid reportedly use “antique computer protocols” which are “probably” safe from cyber hackers,” The New York Times reported.</p>
<p>“If an adversary lands a knockout blow, [experts] fear, it could black out vast areas of the continent for weeks; interrupt supplies of water, gasoline, diesel fuel and fresh food; shut down communications; and create disruptions of a scale that was only hinted at by Hurricane Sandy and the attacks of Sept. 11,” The Times said.</p>
<p>If the power grid fails, a lack of electricity and food delivery are only the first wave of troubles facing the American people. Police could face major problems with civil unrest. Of course, there also would not be any electric heating or cooling, which easily could lead to many deaths depending on the season. (<a href="http://www.offthegridnews.com/2013/08/28/power-grid-down-drill-to-be-conducted-by-us-government/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>The most alarming thing about this drill is the trend of suspected false flag events in America that have corresponded with &#8220;drills&#8221;.  Whether or not this will coincide in a real take-down of the grid remains to be seen, but one only needs to think back to events such as the Boston Marathon Bombing, the 9/11 attacks, and the Oklahoma City Bombing to see that there is a possibility that when &#8220;drills&#8221; occur, often the players are simply being moved into place right under the nose of the public.</p>
<h2>What Can You Do to Be Ready?</h2>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t honestly matter HOW the grid goes down. Whether it is an enemy attack, as in the novel<em> One Second After</em>, a government false flag in order to institute martial law, or a natural act that is the result of a solar flare, a long-term grid collapse will result in an extremely high death toll.</p>
<p>If you are already of the preparedness mindset, you&#8217;ll fare better than the average North American.  However, many people have never contemplated the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How will you get food if the grocery stores are closed?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How will you cook food if you are able to acquire it?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What will happen to the perishable food in your refrigerator and freezer?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How will you heat and cool your home if you are in an area subject to extreme temperatures?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What will you use for light once the scented candle that sits on your coffee table is gone?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How will you transport yourself if a) your vehicle doesn&#8217;t run because the computers are fried or b) it runs but you can&#8217;t get gas because the pumps at the station run on electricity?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What will you drink and wash with if the municipal water facilities are no longer providing water or if the pump on your well runs on electricity?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Find as many solutions as possible for the issues you would face if <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/what-will-you-do-when-the-lights-go-out-11302012" target="_blank">going for weeks (or longer) without power</a>.  You must stay warm, eat, and drink.  Everything else is a bonus. You can live without the television, the video game console, the microwave in the kitchen, and the laptop.</p>
<p>Some people like to give arguments as to why they can’t resolve these issues.  They live in an apartment, they rent, they have a limited budget….the list is as long as indefinite detention.  The fact is, by realizing these things are necessary and refusing to face them and find solutions for your particular situation, you are setting your family up to suffer, and possibly even die, when it could be avoided.</p>
<p>A recent article encouraged readers who were new to prepping to start out by <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/getting-started-prepping-for-a-two-week-power-outage-06292013" target="_blank">getting ready for a two week power outage</a>.  Apply the following  information to create your own preparedness plan for the grid failure that is sure to come. Modify the suggestions to adapt them to your particular home, family, and climate.</p>
<h2>Water</h2>
<p>Everyone knows that clean drinking water is something you can&#8217;t live without. In the event of a disaster, the water may not run from the taps, and if it does, it might not be safe to drink, depending on the situation.  If there is a boil order in place, remember that if the power is out, boiling your water may not be as easy as turning on your stove.</p>
<p>Each family should store a two week supply of water. The rule of thumb for drinking water is 1 gallon per day, per person.  Don&#8217;t forget to stock water for your pets, also.</p>
<p>You can create your water supply very inexpensively.  Many people use clean 2 liter soda pop bottles to store tap water.  Others purchase the large 5 gallon jugs of filtered water from the grocery store.  Consider a gravity fed water filtration device and water purification tablets as well.</p>
<h2>Food and a Way to Prepare It</h2>
<p>There are two schools of thought regarding food during a power outage.  One: you need a cooking method that does not require the grid to be functioning.  Two: you can store food that doesn&#8217;t require cooking.</p>
<p>If you opt for a secondary cooking method, be sure that you have enough fuel for two weeks.  Store foods that do not require long cooking times &#8211; for example, dried beans would use a great deal of fuel, but canned beans could be warmed up, or even eaten cold.</p>

<p>Click <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/power-outage-picnic-02062013" target="_blank">HERE</a> to find a list of foods that require no cooking.</p>
<h2>Heat (Depending on Your Climate)</h2>
<p>If your power outage takes place in the winter and you live in a colder climate, heat is another necessity.  During the first 24 hours after a power outage, you can stay fairly warm if you block off one room of the house for everyone to group together in.  Keep the door closed and keep a towel or blanket folded along the bottom of the door to conserve warmth.  You can safely burn a couple of candles also, and in the enclosed space, your body heat will keep it relatively warm.  As well, dress in layers and keep everything covered &#8211; wear a hat, gloves (fingerless ones allow you to still function), and a scarf.</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/how-to-stay-warm-with-less-heat-2-12042012" target="_blank">HERE</a> to learn how to stay warm with less heat.</p>
<p>However, after about 48 hours, that&#8217;s not going to be enough in very cold weather. You will require back-up heat at this point in certain climates.  If you are lucky enough to have a source of heat like a fireplace or woodstove, you&#8217;ll be just fine as long as you have a supply of wood.</p>
<p>Consider a portable propane heater (and propane) or an oil heater.  You have to be very careful what type of backup heat you plan on using, as many of them can cause carbon monoxide poisoning if used in a poorly ventilated area.</p>

<h2><strong>Sanitation Needs</strong></h2>
<p>A common cause of illness, and even death, during a down-grid situation is lack of sanitation.  We&#8217;ve discussed the importance of clean drinking water, but you won&#8217;t want to use your drinking water to keep things clean or to flush the toilet.</p>
<p>For cleaning, reduce your need to wash things. Stock up on paper plates, paper towels, and disposable cups and flatware.  Keep some disinfecting cleaning wipes and sprays (I don&#8217;t recommend using antibacterial products on a regular basis, however in the event of an emergency they can help to keep you healthy.)  Use hand sanitizer after using the bathroom and before handing food or beverages &#8211; there may be a lot more germs afoot in a disaster.</p>
<p>Look at your options for sanitation.  Does your toilet still flush when the electricity is out?  Many people discovered the hard way that the toilets didn&#8217;t work  when the sewage backed up in the highrises in New York City in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.  At our cabin, the toilet won&#8217;t flush without power because the pump is electric.</p>
<p>If you are on a septic system, with no risk of the toilet backing up into the house, simply store some water for flushing in the bathroom.  (At the first sign of a storm, we always fill the bathtub for this purpose.)  Add the water to the tank so that you can flush.</p>
<p>If this is not an option, another solution is to stock up on extremely heavy duty garbage bags (like the kind that contractors use at construction sites) and kitty litter.  Place a bag either in your drained toilet or in a bucket.  Sprinkle some kitty litter in the bottom of the bag.  Each time someone uses the bathroom, add another handful of litter. Be very careful that the bag doesn&#8217;t get too heavy for you to handle it.  Tie it up very securely and store it outside until services are restored.</p>
<h2>Light</h2>
<p>Lighting is absolutely vital, especially if there are children in the house.  Nothing is more frightening than being completely in the dark during a stressful situation. Fortunately, it&#8217;s one of the easiest things to plan for, as well as one of the least expensive.</p>
<p>Some lighting solutions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Garden stake solar lights</li>
<li>Candles</li>
<li>Kerosene lamps</li>
<li>Flashlights (don&#8217;t forget batteries)</li>
<li>Hand crank camping lantern</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t forget matches or lighters</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tools and Supplies</h2>
<p>Some basic items will make your life much easier during an emergency. Here are some things that are essential in the event of a power outage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lighter/waterproof matches</li>
<li>Batteries in various sizes</li>
<li>Manual can opener</li>
<li>Basic tools: <strong></strong>Pliers, screwdriver, wrench, hammer</li>
<li>Duct tape</li>
<li>Crazy glue</li>
<li>Sewing supplies</li>
<li>Bungee cords</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to expand on the basic supplies, a more detailed list of tools and hardware can be found <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/week-16-of-52-survival-tools-list-2_19082011/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<h2>First Aid Kit</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s important to have a basic first aid kit on hand at all times, but particularly in the event of an emergency.  Your kit should include basic wound care items like bandages, antibiotic ointments, and sprays.  As well, if you use them, keep on hand a supply of basic over-the-counter medications, like pain relief capsules, cold medicine, cough syrup, anti-nausea pills, and allergy medication. Particularly important if sanitation is a problem are anti-diarheal medications.</p>
<p>If you want to put together a more advanced medical kit, you can find a list<a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/emergency-medical-supply-list-2_01072011/" target="_blank"> HERE</a>.</p>
<h2>Special Needs</h2>
<p>This is something that will be unique to every family. Consider the things that are needed on a daily basis in your household. It might be prescription medications, diapers, or special foods.  If you have pets, you&#8217;ll need supplies for them too.  The best way to figure out what you need is to jot things down as you use them over the course of a week or so.</p>
<h2>Get Started Today</h2>
<p>You can start right now &#8211; this very minute &#8211; all you have to do is grab a pad of paper and a pen.</p>
<ol>
<li>Begin by personalizing the suggestions above to fit your family&#8217;s needs and make a list of your requirements.</li>
<li>Next, do a quick inventory &#8211; as I mentioned above, you may be surprised to see that you already have quite a few of the supplies that are recommended.</li>
<li>Make a shopping list and acquire the rest of the items you need.  If you can&#8217;t afford everything right now, prioritize the most important things first.</li>
<li>Organize your supplies so that they are easily accessible when you need them. It&#8217;s hard to find seldom-used items in the dark.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the lights go out, don&#8217;t be left to the not-so-tender mercies of those who would place themselves in charge.  Maintain your independence by strengthening the position of your family.  Take steps towards preparedness and self-sufficiency so  that you won&#8217;t need the government&#8217;s assistance to weather the storm.</p>
<p>If you must comply to survive, your freedom is just an illusion. You&#8217;ve been warned &#8211; what you do with the information is up to you.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">In every relationship there comes a time when you have to sit down and take a serious look at the future.  Where do you want to go?  Are your goals compatible?  Are things working as they stand right now or do some changes need to be made?</span></p>
<p>Your pantry is no different.  People create food storage stockpiles for many different reasons, and because of this, there is no &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; formula for doing so. You must figure out what your goals are and develop a road map towards achieving them.</p>
<p>Having a food supply just makes sense.  Every time there is a disaster, the masses become hysterical and <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/grid-down-acapulco-theres-nothing-to-eat_09192013" target="_blank">chaos ensues</a> because there is no food available because of our<a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/emergency-preparedness/just-in-time-when-the-trucks-stop-america-will-stop-with-immediate-and-catastrophic-consequences_04022012" target="_blank"> &#8220;just-in-time&#8221; food delivery system</a>. Your stockpile can mean the difference between <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/how-many-buckets-of-freedom-do-you-have-02252013" target="_blank">continued freedom</a> and bowing down to your &#8220;masters&#8221; for a cold MRE and a bottle of water.</p>
<p>There are three basic types of food supplies.  Learn about these food storage ideologies and then take the most applicable strategies and combine them to create your own version of the Ultimate Pantry.</p>
<h2>The Bunker Pantry</h2>
<p>This is the most &#8220;hardcore&#8221; of the food storage types.  A Bunker Pantry is the type of food supply that could keep you going for the next ten years without a single trip to the store.  Sure, it might be a little bit boring and lacking in variety, but it is a supply that will see you through any disaster that allows you to remain in your shelter.  This type of pantry focuses on huge quantities of long-term foods, repackaged carefully to resist spoilage due to pests or the elements.</p>
<p>If this is the type of pantry you&#8217;d like to build, focus on staples such as wheat, rice, dried beans, salt, and sugar.  Check out this article on <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/11-emergency-food-items-that-can-last-a-lifetime_20082013/" target="_blank">11 Emergency Food Items That Can Last a Lifetime</a> for more suggestions. These foods can be purchased in bulk and<a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/are-you-ready-series-best-practices-for-long-term-food-storage_03042011/" target="_blank"> repackaged by the user</a>, or you can purchase them already packaged up through vendors like the LDS warehouse or online food storage websites.</p>
<p>Variety can be added to this type of pantry through commercially canned fruits, vegetables, and meats.  When looking for sales on these items, be sure to check the expiration dates. If you are storing for the long-term you want to be certain to grab cans with the longest shelflife.</p>
<p>Another great way to add fruits, veggies, meats, and dairy to your Bunker Pantry is through the <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/fun-with-freeze-dried-food_20072012/" target="_blank">addition of freeze-dried foods</a>. If properly packaged, these foods can last up to 25 years.  As long as you have water to rehydrate these foods, your diet can remain fairly normal throughout a long-term scenario. Imagine rehydrating the ingredients to make a fluffy cheese omelet with ham and peppers!</p>
<p>It takes a lot of space to store this much food, so generally a dedicated area must be used as a storeroom.  Items should be clearly marked with expiration dates, and when that date draws near, the items should be rotated in to the family&#8217;s kitchen.</p>
<h2>The Agrarian Pantry</h2>
<p>This type of pantry is the kind our ancestors had.  Most of the purchases are made during the growing season and only small shopping trips are needed to supplement this throughout the year. It combines enough basic staples for the year ahead with enough of your preserved harvest to get you through the next growing season.  (This is the type of pantry that we keep in our family, with a few of the other strategies added to increase the usefulness of our stockpile.).</p>
<p>To build an Agrarian Pantry, stock up on a year&#8217;s supply of basics like grains, baking items, tea, coffee, and dried beans.  Then focus your efforts on acquiring items in season and preserving them when they are at their peak.  Try your hand at canning, dehydrating, and <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/how-to-create-a-root-cellar-for-food-storage-09142013" target="_blank">root cellaring</a>.  Items can be grown on your own property or purchased by the bushel from local farms and orchards.</p>
<p>Look into purchasing a side of beef and a side of pork to add to your pantry. One purchase per year is sufficient for most families, and your price per pound drops dramatically when you buy meat in this type of quantity.  Don&#8217;t put all your faith in the deep freezer, however, because a grid-down scenario could leave you with a smelly mess and a large lost investment.  Try canning, smoking, salting and dehydrating for the bulk of your meat purchases.</p>
<p>This type of pantry must be replenished every year. Basically, the items in your pantry are purchased and put back with the intention of consuming them within the next 12 months.</p>
<h2>The Bargain-Hunter&#8217;s Pantry</h2>
<p>This is the type of pantry made famous by the extreme couponing shows.  Using a variety of strategies, people can amass an enormous quantity of food for very little money.  Couponing, sale shopping, bartering, and buying from outlet stores and warehouses can help to create a pantry full of packaged items.</p>
<p>While this is a great way to get started or to supplement your other strategies, this is my least favorite way to create a stockpile.  This is simply for two reasons: much of what you are acquiring is<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/nutrition-101-how-processed-foods-make-us-fat-malnourished-and-sick-06222013" target="_blank"> highly processed</a>, and without a lot of personal discipline, you aren&#8217;t building a balanced pantry, but just stockpiling whatever is the cheapest.  If you use this method, you must be extremely careful not to end up with a pantry full of carbs, but no protein or fruits and veggies. (25 cent ketchup is NOT a vegetable)</p>
<p>Warnings aside, you can build up a huge amount of food on a very limited budget and still be careful if you are a smart shopper.  Read <a href="http://momwithaprep.com/2013/09/04/build-better-pantry-use-coupons-help-prepare-emergencies/" target="_blank">THIS</a> and <a href="http://momwithaprep.com/2013/09/09/build-better-pantry-use-sales-cycles-help-prepare-emergencies/" target="_blank">THIS</a> to learn how.</p>
<p>When building a Bargain Hunter&#8217;s Pantry, consider the following suggestions to create more balance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for the items with the least number of ingredients &#8211; don&#8217;t stock your shelves with chemistry projects, no matter how cheap they are.</li>
<li>Strive for balance by creating an inventory list to keep in your purse so that you know which types off foods are needed to keep your family healthy. (Are you short of protein sources?  veggies? healthy fats?)</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t add it to your stockpile merely because it&#8217;s cheap, particularly if your storage space is limited.</li>
<li>Be sure to rotate the items into you kitchen by expiry date.  Often the items that have the deepest discounts are the closest to expiration, You aren&#8217;t saving money if you end up throwing out spoiled food.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Combine the Best of Each Strategy to Build the Ultimate Pantry</h2>
<p>The Ultimate Pantry combines the three strategies listed above to create the optimal supply for the needs of your particular family.</p>
<p>The key is organization.  Keep the following tips in mind to create the best possible pantry.</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep an up-to-date inventory so that you know what you have</li>
<li>Catalog your coupons by type and expiration date</li>
<li>Track the sales cycles</li>
<li>Keep your products rotated into your kitchen so that you don&#8217;t lose foods to missed expiration dates.</li>
<li>Store longer term foods in optimum conditions to prolong their viability.</li>
<li>Maintain a list of what is needed to balance your pantry nutritionally so that you can focus on those items when an unexpected bargain pops up.</li>
<li>Buy pantry staples (like beans in grains) in the largest quantities you can manage in order to maximize your savings.</li>
<li>Remember the adage &#8220;Store what you eat and eat what you store&#8221; &#8211; it isn&#8217;t a bargain if you purchase something no one in your family will eat.</li>
<li>Supplement your pantry by growing as much as possible in your particular circumstances, even if you are just adding a windowsill herb and salad garden.</li>
<li>Tap into your inner hunter-gatherer with strategies like foraging, fishing, snaring, and hunting.</li>
<li>Purchase seasonally and in large quantities from local growers (or harvest from your own gardens).</li>
<li>Become a food preservation expert and stock up on the necessary tools and supplies.</li>

<p>Sometimes a school does something so magnificently idiotic in the name of education, you have to wonder if it is pure thoughtless stupidity or a deliberate attempt to brainwash kids into eternal obedience.</p>
<p>I recently wrote about <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/is-your-child-a-student-or-a-slave-08262013" target="_blank">my own daughter&#8217;s experience at her new school where the kids were supposed to kneel</a> to the teachers when a whistle blew.  Melissa Melton of Truthstream Media<a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/public-school-made-my-kid-imagine-herself-dying-in-the-twin-towers-on-911/" target="_blank"> wrote about her daughter&#8217;s 9/11 assignment</a> in which she was to imagine a horrible death at the hands of terrorists.</p>
<p>And now we learn of the appalling exercise that students of Hartford Magnet Trinity College Academy underwent at a Nature&#8217;s Classroom field trip &#8211; an educational experience, <a href="http://www.naturesclassroom.org/index.htm" target="_blank">according to the website</a>, that was guaranteed to bring the kids closer together. “After spending a week at Nature’s Classroom, living and learning together, students develop a sense of community, a confidence in themselves and an appreciation for others that carries over to the school community.”</p>
<p>What better way to learn about the Underground Railroad and the horrors of slavery than to make the kids act like slaves, call them the N-word, and have the teacher-masters chase them through the forest?</p>
<p>One young girl (who is, incidentally, black) tells of her emotionally traumatic experience &#8211; one that would send me, as a parent, straight to the school board in a state of righteous rage the likes of which the &#8220;educators&#8221; would never forget.</p>
<p>James Baker, the girl&#8217;s father, read his daughter&#8217;s account of the &#8220;learning experience&#8221; to the Hartford Board of Education.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was told about the reenactment about a ½ hour before it started.</p>
<p>The Ship (pretend ship)</p>
<p>Before we went into the dark room, we were lined up outside and asked to close our eyes and imagine having to run with our families in Africa. The slave master finds us and beats, stabs and kills my father in front of me and then takes me away from my family. I went into a dark room where I had to sit on my bottom with my knees together; my legs fell  asleep and were hurting. We were jammed together tightly touching each other.</p>
<p><strong>While in the dark room,</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was told by the instructor that we will go to the bathroom on each other, and some of us might throw up.</li>
<li>The instructor told me, “We don’t need any sick slaves. If you get sick we will throw you over board.”</li>
<li>I was told sharks were following the ship and that they could smell our blood.</li>
<li>I was told I may have to dance to entertain them</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the woods (later)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> I had to pretend I was picking cotton, like a real slave.</li>
<li>I had to hold my head down and could not make eye contact with the white masters</li>
<li>I was told the slaves had to work until our hands were raw and bleeding</li>
<li>I heard the instructor ask the kids behind me to open their mouths so their teeth could</li>
<li>be checked. Some were asked to jump up and down.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sandra Baker, the young girl&#8217;s mother, also chimed in and shared some of the horrific things that were said to the children.</p>
<blockquote><p>The following comments were taken from the Nature’s Classroom Underground Railroad Report, which was completed by, the Hartford Magnet Trinity College Academy February 25 –April 18, 2013. I ask that you imagine these phrases being yelled at your 10 to 12 year old child and her friends: Here is some of the language used in the reenactment exercise:</p>
<ul>

<p>Can you believe that this is happening in America?</p>
<p>Every child in the public school system is being programmed to submit.  An<a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/public-school-made-my-kid-imagine-herself-dying-in-the-twin-towers-on-911/" target="_blank"> article from Truthstream Media</a> lists some recent outrages that make the above experience look perfectly, appallingly normal:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Fourth grade students in Illinois were recently given a “<a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/u-s-elementary-school-homework-teaches-kids-government-is-family_092013" target="_blank">What Is Government?</a>” worksheet with a cartoon Uncle Sam character holding a baby wearing a matching stars and bars top hat that literally told the children “Government is like a nation’s family. Families take care of children and make sure they are safe, healthy and educated, and free to enjoy life.” Uh-huh. Apparently Uncle Sam actually believes he’s your uncle now.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>A private school in New York City made students as young as 14 write <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/06/12/suicide-note-homework-assignment-has-nyc-parents-in-an-uproar/" target="_blank">suicide notes</a> that included justification for why they would kill themselves.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Arizona fourth graders were given a worksheet asking students <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/02/19/mother-outraged-after-4th-grader-brings-home-adult-themed-homework-about-infidelity/" target="_blank">what would happen</a> if a woman found another woman’s hairclip under her bed. One girl wrote, “The husband had cheated, and he was in big trouble.” The school apologized, claiming the teacher hadn’t fully read the assignment before handing it out.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Kindergarteners in Illinois are being taught sex education, including the examination of different family structures, such as whether or not there’s two moms at home. The curriculum follows the recommendations of The Future of Sex Education (FoSE) sponsored in part by the Society of State Leaders of Health and Physical Education that includes an advisory committee of senior officials from Planned Parenthood and the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN).</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Seems like fourth graders are particularly targeted. This time fourth grade students in Florida were made to write, “<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/dad-furious-finding-crayon-written-paper-florida-4th-124614291.html" target="_blank">I Am Willing to Give Up Some of My Constitutional Rights</a>…to Be Safer” following a lesson on the Constitution.</p></blockquote>

<li>
<blockquote><p>Earlier this year, female high school students in a small Texas town were girls were made to dress up in full-length Islamic burqas while students were told Muslim terrorists are to be referred to as “<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/02/students-made-to-wear-burqas-in-u-s-state/" target="_blank">freedom fighters</a>“.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Tenth graders <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/12/fifty-shades-of-the-common-core-how-much-porn-is-too-much-for-high-schoolers/" target="_blank">fell victim to the common core in Arizona</a>, as students were made to read passages from the novel <em>Dreaming in Cuban</em> by Cristina Garcia out loud in class. Here’s an example: “Hugo and Felicia stripped in their room, dissolving easily into one another, and made love against the whitewashed walls. Hugo bit Felicia’s breast and left purplish bands of bruises on her upper thighs. He knelt before her in the tub and massaged black Spanish soap between her legs. He entered her repeatedly from behind.” All that before she ties the guy up with her underwear and he calls her his Bitch. That’s what passes for tenth grade reading material in this country. Who could make this up?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A teacher in Tennessee banned a ten-year-old girl <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/13/school-teacher-tells-10-year-old-girl-she-cant-write-about-god-as-her-idol/" target="_blank">from writing about God</a>.</p></blockquote>

</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Even online charter schools parents homeschool through are not indoctrination-free. A homeschooling dad from Maine found his son was being subjected to lessons that espouse the virtues of <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/chinarises/gettingrich/" target="_blank">communist China</a>.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>A Texas fifth grader was given a CSCOPE curriculum worksheet entitled, “<a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/04/02/want-to-see-what-cscope-and-common-core-even-homeschooling-lessons-look-like-these-parents-opened-up-to-theblaze/" target="_blank">Why Can’t Kids Vote?</a>” that said, “Adults think we don’t understand things like global warming and war. But we know these are things that need to be fixed. Adults have not fixed any of it yet, so maybe it’s time to give the kids a chance to make things better. The adults clearly need our help because they do not always make the best decisions.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A third grade teacher in Georgia gave the class <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2012/01/07/if-frederick-got-two-beatings-per-day-parents-outraged-over-slavery-questions-in-3rd-grade-math-homework/" target="_blank">slavery-themed math homework</a> with questions like, “If Frederick got two beatings per day, how many beatings did he get in one week?” (<a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/public-school-made-my-kid-imagine-herself-dying-in-the-twin-towers-on-911/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>

</ul>
<p>Despite the passionate opinions of some zealous homeschoolers, not everyone can realistically teach their children at home, for a variety of reasons.  Perhaps the family is led by a single parent who must work full time. Some parents are working more than one job to make ends meet as the economy continues to plummet.  Some parents are not well-educated themselves and do not feel competent to homeschool their kids.  Some kids &#8211; perfectly intelligent, bright children who are hungry to learn &#8211; just don&#8217;t have families who are involved in their educations.</p>
<p>The public school system, however broken it may be, is the only chance for many children to receive an education.  Our tax dollars fund these school systems, and therefore the administrators must be held accountable.  We can&#8217;t allow them to further the government agenda of subduing, terrorizing, and dumbing down our future through trauma-based brainwashing.</p>

<p>Do you have any 3rd graders in your life?   If they&#8217;re anything like the little 8 year old girls I know, they are probably playing with My Little Ponies and Polly Pockets, going to school, listening to One Direction, and painting their fingernails (out on the back porch so as not to get nail polish all over the house).</p>
<p>Because that is the life of 8 year old girls in America.</p>
<p>In many Islamic countries, however,  8 year old girls are donning fancy white dresses and going to get married to adult men.  The picture below is of a mass wedding in Gaza. (see author&#8217;s note below)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/?attachment_id=57713" rel="attachment wp-att-57713"><img class="aligncenter" alt="mass-muslim-wedding-to-child-brides-gaza" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mass-muslim-wedding-to-child-brides-gaza.jpg" width="496" height="376" /></a></p>
<p>Recent news reports from Yemen tell of such a child who died on her wedding night.</p>
<p>An 8 year old little girl named Rawan<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2415871/Yemeni-child-bride-8-dies-internal-injuries-night-forced-marriage-groom-40.html#ixzz2ePBOHaxG" target="_blank"> died from injuries sustained within her young, immature body</a> when her 40 year old husband had intercourse with her.  The child bled to death in this perverted parody of a marriage after she was sold to her &#8220;husband&#8221; by her impoverished family.</p>
<p>It would be horrific enough if this was a one-time tragedy, but this is a regular custom for young Muslim girls, especially in impoverished countries.  In 2010, a 13 year old girl (a 7th grader in America) died the same way &#8211; she <a href="http://patdollard.com/2010/04/13-year-old-yemeni-child-bride-dies-of-sex-bleeding/" target="_blank">hemorrhaged for 5 days </a> until she bled to death after wedding night sex with her husband.  Also in 2010, another 12 year old girl <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/yemen/yemeni-12-year-old-dies-while-giving-birth-to-a-stillborn-1.539240" target="_blank"> died in labor after struggling to give birth for 3 days</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently girls are far easier to mold into &#8220;good Muslim wives&#8221; if you get them when they&#8217;re young.  More than a quarter of girls in Yemen are sold into marriage before the age of 15.</p>
<p>The husband of little Rawan was not arrested.  The parents of Rawan were not arrested.  This was all perfectly legal, so Rawan&#8217;s agonizing, terrifying death is considered just an unfortunate accident in Yemen, with no more blame laid than if she had been the victim of a random lightning strike or any other unpreventable incident.</p>
<p>This is part of Sharia law.  This is part of the &#8220;Religion of Peace.&#8221; Directly from the <a href="http://nafsadh.com/hadith/bukhari/7/62" target="_blank">Quran</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with ‘Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death).” — <strong>Bukhari 7.62.88</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>According to the site <a href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia" target="_blank">Wiki Islam</a>, this type of pedophilia is not only acceptable, but encouraged.  Due to religious reasons, laws cannot be made to discontinue the sickening practice.</p>
<blockquote><p>Due to its many endorsements within Islamic scripture, child marriages are permitted by the majority of Muslim scholars and leaders, and in many Islamic countries it is common practice. Girls far below the age of puberty are forcibly married to older persons (sometimes in their 50s and later) for various personal gains by the girls&#8217; guardian or with the intention to preserve family honor by helping her avoid pre-marital sex.</p>
<p>Pedophilic Islamic marriages are most prevalent in Pakistan and Afghanistan, followed by other countries in the <a title="Middle East" href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Middle_East">Middle East</a> and Bangladesh.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> This practice may also be prevalent to a lesser extent amongst other Muslim communities, and is on the rise among the growing Muslim populations in many non-Muslim countries, such as the United Kingdom<sup id="cite_ref-Ten-fold_rise_in_forced_marriages_in_just_four_years_7-0"><a href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia#cite_note-Ten-fold_rise_in_forced_marriages_in_just_four_years-7">[7]</a></sup> and the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>In countries like Yemen, Bangladesh, Iran, and Northern Nigeria, attempts at reforming laws and banning child marriages have been opposed and stopped on the grounds that such a ban would be un-Islamic,<sup id="cite_ref-TONOV282008_9-0"><a href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia#cite_note-TONOV282008-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-TNTJuly212013_10-0"><a href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia#cite_note-TNTJuly212013-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Weekly_Blitz_11-0"><a href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia#cite_note-Weekly_Blitz-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-MESSAGE_12-0"><a href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia#cite_note-MESSAGE-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-IRIN_13-0"><a href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia#cite_note-IRIN-13">[13]</a></sup> and in the case of Malaysia, the growing Muslim population has effectively turned back the clock on social progress by passing new laws which allow for the practice of pedophilic marriages specifically between followers of Islam.<sup id="cite_ref-World_News_Australia_14-0"><a href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia#cite_note-World_News_Australia-14">[14]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Human rights activists are rightfully outraged by these senseless deaths, but flouting hundreds of years of customs and a religion that is practiced by nearly a quarter of the world&#8217;s population has proven to be a difficult battle.  Those who disagree with these practices are being painted as intolerant, racist, and anti-Muslim. How dare we step on the tenets of their faith? If you say this is wrong in an Islamic country, you&#8217;re liable to get your head promptly lopped off.</p>
<p>This subject is certainly not one of the normal topics on my website, but as the mother of two precious girls, I feel obligated to say something for little Rawan and the thousands of other girls who are abused like this, and not just shake my head at the dreadful tragedy of the ordeal these little ones undergo.  This isn&#8217;t &#8220;Christian vs. Muslim&#8221;, but &#8220;Right vs. Wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to be the parent of girls to be outraged by this practice and by the religion that turns it into a &#8220;right&#8221;. You just have to be a human being with a sense of right and wrong and one who believes that the innocence and well-being of children &#8211; wherever they happen to be born &#8211; should be protected.  I&#8217;ve always considered myself to be very tolerant of other people&#8217;s faith or personal belief system because I expect others to be tolerant of my right to believe the way I do.  But when horrific, fatal child abuse is sanctioned because the Quran says it&#8217;s okay &#8211; well, that is where I draw the line of tolerance and acceptance.</p>
<p>For now, however, the practice putting little girls in a pretty white dress and then raping them to death remains legal in many parts of the world because we certainly can&#8217;t infringe on the &#8220;religious freedom&#8221; that protects the dirty old men who believe it is their deity-given right to do so.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Author&#8217;s Note</strong>:  <em>I&#8217;ve received numerous emails and comments that the photos above of the little girls were not wedding photos, as the websites where I found them indicated.  What remains inarguable is that little girls ARE being wed to adult men, and they are dying as a result of sexual intercourse at too young an age.

<p>The  FY14 Continuing Resolution (CR) spending bill  is soon to be on the table in the Senate, and hidden in this bill is a continuance of the controversial &#8220;Monsanto Protection Act&#8221; that was passed 6 months ago (HR 933) amidst enormous public outcry.</p>
<p>It probably won&#8217;t come as much of a surprise that the mainstream media is providing disinformation regarding this bill &#8211; after all &#8211; look at their advertisers. It&#8217;s just good business for them to go with the flow on this. According to mainstream sources, this is being presented as a done deal, when in fact, it has only passed the House and must still go before both the Senate and the President.</p>
<p>Of course, last time around that didn&#8217;t really help us much &#8211; let us not forget those who greedily ignored the wishes of the American people in favor of biotech dollars and influence:</p>

<p>The new bill surreptitiously passed the vote in the House of Representatives on Tuesday evening of last week.  It exempts the large biotech companies from judicial review and lawsuits in the event that the farming methods or crops cause health or environmental issues, and it also means that once the crops are planted, no matter what is discovered about the effects of those crops, they can still be taken to market and sold.</p>
<p>The Center for Food Safety<a href="http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/press-releases/2509/house-ignores-public-outcry-extends-controversial-monsanto-protection-act" target="_blank"> released the following statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is extremely disappointing to see the damaging ‘Monsanto Protection Act’ policy rider extended in the House spending bill,” said Colin O’Neil, director of government affairs for Center for Food Safety. “Hundreds of thousands of Americans called their elected officials to voice their frustration and disappointment over the inclusion of ‘Monsanto Protection Act’ this past spring. Its inclusion is a slap in the face to the American public and our justice system.”</p>
<p>Wrapped in a “farmer-friendly” package, the rider represents a serious assault on the fundamental safeguards of our judicial system and would negatively impact farmers, the environment and public health across America.  The rider would strip federal courts of their authority to halt the sale and planting of an illegal, potentially hazardous GE crop and compel USDA to allow continued planting of that same crop upon request.</p>
<p>In addition to being completely unnecessary, the rider represents an unprecedented attack on U.S. judicial review, which is an essential element of U.S. law and provides a critical check on government decisions that may negatively impact human health, the environment or livelihoods. This also raises potential jurisdictional concerns with the Senate Agriculture and Judiciary Committees that merited hearings by the Committees before its consideration.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">This time around, the protection rider is even more troubling because of the <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/move-over-round-up-usda-approves-2nd-gen-gmos-that-can-withstand-even-deadlier-herbicide-09012013" target="_blank">recent approval of &#8220;2nd generation GMOs&#8221;</a>.  These virtually untested genetically modified seeds were created to survive the spraying of an even more deadly chemical than </span>glyophosate, the previous poison of choice. Isoxaflutole (IFT) will soon be dousing the breadbasket of America, despite the fact that <strong>the EPA KNOWS IT CAUSES CANCER.</strong> The <a href="http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/registration/fs_PC-123000_15-Sep-98.pdf" target="_blank">EPA&#8217;s fact sheet on IFT</a> is nothing short of terrifying &#8211; it&#8217;s a must-read.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right &#8211; it is classified as a &#8220;probable human carcinogen&#8221; and the EPA has warned that it is likely to contaminate soil, air, and groundwater.  If you live any place downwind or downstream of a GMO farm, you are in the new cancer zone.</p>
<p>And Congress &#8211; our duly elected representation &#8211; is saying that you have NO LEGAL RECOURSE with this extension of the rider.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that public outcry did nothing to change things the last time around, we need to rally up and contact the offices of our senators. Let them know that you will not support a senator who does not support your health and well-being and chooses instead to offer a free pass to big business.    Be louder this time around &#8211; spread the word via this article and any others you can find.  Share this on your social media. Sign petitions. Write letters. Protest.  They may pass it anyway, but we CAN still make others aware of the depth of the corruption and the incestuous relationship between biotech and our government.</p>

<p>In our agrarian past, we didn&#8217;t have  a grocery store in every town receiving shipments of fresh fruits and vegetables from all corners of the world on a daily basis.  Food preservation was a necessity to survive the long winter in most locations.  Over the centuries, many have gotten their winter produce fix from a simple non-tech solution:  the root cellar.</p>
<p>Last year when I did my <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/stockpile-challenge-conclusion-01312013" target="_blank">One-Month Stockpile Challenge</a>, I realized that this was a glaring omission in my food stockpile process, so this year, I&#8217;m determined to add this strategy to take my stockpile to the next level.  Fall is the perfect time to begin because for the next few months, those hard-shelled root vegetables as well as items like apples and potatoes, will be abundant and cheap.</p>
<p>The first root cellars in recorded history were in Australia &#8211; 40,000 years ago it is indicated that they were burying their yam harvests in order to keep them fresh.  Since then, underground food storage caches have been found all over the world, as people took advantage of the cool moist atmosphere a few feet down.</p>
<h2>THE IDEAL ROOT CELLAR</h2>
<p>Root cellars are often in the basement of one&#8217;s home or in a separate concrete or stone cellar just outside the home.  Michigan State University offers these tips on conditions for the ideal root cellar:</p>
<blockquote><p>The produce is still alive – stored carbohydrates of energy is consumed in the presence of oxygen and produces heat and carbon dioxide. To maintain the proper “living” conditions, at least three variables need to be considered: temperature, humidity and ventilation.</p>
<p>Temperature:</p>
<p>Most cold tolerant or cool season crops will store best between 33 and 35F or just above freezing and up to 40F. Warm season crops sensitive to chilling injury (tomatoes, cucumbers, etc) are typically stored at temperatures above 50F unless processing, cooking or eating will occur shortly after removal from storage. The temperature needs to be actively monitored and managed and will vary with the quantity of produce in the space.</p>
<p>Humidity:</p>
<p>Most root and leafy crops will store best at high humidity (+80%) or moisture levels. Root crops like carrots need to be stored in some moist medium to maintain quality. Some crops like onion, garlic and winter squash store better at low humidity level (less than 60%). Moisture may need to be added by wetting the floor or walls with water depending on the construction methods.</p>
<p>Ventilation:</p>
<p>Reasons for ventilation include: 1) removal of heat of respiration, 2) replenishing the oxygen supply, 3) removing volatile compounds from the produce that may effect flavor or sprouting like ethylene. The greater the density or amount of produce in the space, the more ventilation is needed. Ventilation or air tubes need to be planned prior to construction and place during construction.</p>
<p>Common storage categories are 1) cold dry, 2) cold moist, 3) cool dry, 4) cool moist. (<a href="http://www.msue.msu.edu/objects/content_revision/download.cfm/item_id.521410/workspace_id.26785/Root%20Cellars%20on%20the%20Small%20Farm.pdf/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>The University of Alaska Fairbanks Cooperative Extension Service in cooperation with the United States Department of Agriculture offers the following chart with storage information for specific produce:</p>

<h2>ORGANIZATION OF YOUR ROOT CELLAR</h2>
<p>You can&#8217;t just place everything together and hope for your food to all remain fresh.  Some items cannot be stored together because they release a gas called ethylene.  Ethylene gas is a ripening agent,which hastens the decomposition of other produce.</p>
<p>For example, apples, pears, and tomatoes produce high amounts of ethylene and should be placed higher than other foods, and near vents if possible.  They should not be placed near potatoes and carrots, as the ethylene will cause those to spoil rapidly.</p>
<p>Some produce will easily absorb odors from items with strong smells.  Strong smelling foods like cabbages or turnips can be wrapped in newspaper to help contain the smell. Onions store well when hung in mesh bags.</p>
<p>Some produce is stored more successfully if cured at a temperature of 80-90 degrees F for 10 days before being placed into storage:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">winter squash</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">onions</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">potatoes</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">garlic</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Two small investments for your root cellar should be a thermometer to measure temperature and a hygrometer to measure humidity. This way you can ensure your conditions are right to keep your food fresh for the longest possible time.</p>

<p>I was recently doing some research about the aftermath of some natural disasters that took place here in America. I was shocked to find that the articles I was looking for &#8211; ones that I had read in the past &#8211; were pretty hard to find, but articles refuting the sought-for pieces were rampant.  Not just one event, but every single crisis aftermath that I looked up, had articles that were written after the fact stating in no uncertain terms that the hunger, chaos, and unrest never happened.</p>
<p>Apparently we, the preparedness community, are all wrong when it comes to the belief that after a disaster, chaos erupts and civic disorder is the rule of the day.</p>
<p>According to &#8220;experts&#8221; it never happens.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/looters2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2223 aligncenter" alt="looters2" src="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/looters2-300x212.jpg" width="300" height="212" /></a></p>
<h2>Panic?  What panic?</h2>
<p>According to newspaper articles written <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/11/looting_after_hurricane_sandy_disaster_myths_and_disaster_utopias_explained.html" target="_blank">after Superstorm Sandy</a> devastated the East Coast and after <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/natural-disasters/2315076" target="_blank">Hurricane Katrina </a>caused countless billions in damage in New Orleans, people were calm, benevolent and peaceful.  Heck, they were all standing around singing Kumbayah around a campfire, sharing their canned goods, calming frightened puppies, and helping the elderly.</p>
<p>Apparently studies <em>prove</em> that the fear of anarchy, lawlessness, and chaos is nothing but the &#8220;disaster myth&#8221;.  Reams of examples exist of the goodness and warmth of society as a whole after disaster strikes. All the stories you read at the time were just that &#8211; stories, according to the mainstream media:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet there are a few examples stubbornly fixed in the popular imagination of people reacting to a natural disaster by becoming primal and vicious. Remember the gangs &#8220;marauding&#8221; through New Orleans, raping and even cannibalizing people in the Super-Dome after Hurricane Katrina? It turns out they didn&#8217;t exist. Years of journalistic investigations showed them to be racist fantasies. They didn&#8217;t happen. Yes, there was some &#8220;looting&#8221; &#8212; which consisted of starving people breaking into closed and abandoned shops for food. Of course human beings can behave atrociously &#8211; but the aftermath of a disaster seems to be the time when it is least likely. (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johann-hari/the-myth-of-the-panicking_b_837440.html" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Looting?</strong>  Only hungry people getting food from unmanned stores. Who wouldn&#8217;t do that?</p>
<p><strong>Beatings and assaults?</strong>  Didn&#8217;t happen. Disturbed people made these stories up for attention.</p>
<p><strong>Gang rapes?</strong>  No way. You watch too much <em>Law and Order: SVU</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Murder, mayhem, and gangs of youth on the streets?</strong>  Silly readers &#8211; we just made that up.</p>

<p>The Disaster Myth is a narrative created by the establishment and delivered by their stoolies in <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/7-things-about-the-mainstream-media-that-they-do-not-want-you-to-know" target="_blank">the mainstream media</a>.  The Disaster Myth points fingers at many of the things that are commonly believed to be true by the preparedness community.  Included in this narrative:</p>
<ol>
<li>

</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">These statements all stand in direct opposition to the stories we hear from news sources during the crisis.  We heard terrible stories from eyewitnesses who suffered from hunger, thirst, and unsanitary condition in the Superdome after Katrina.  We heard about citizens being robbed of their 2nd Amendment rights by police after the crisis, and we heard about gang rapes, looting, and mayhem.  Fast forward to Sandy where people were defecating in the hallways of their high rise apartments and digging through garbage to find food just a few days after the storm.  As for the official response, who can forget the FEMA shelter that closed because of inclement weather?  Of course the weather was inclement &#8211; it was a freaking weather-related disaster!</span></p>

<p>In the midst of crisis, once civilized societies will very rapidly descend into chaos when essential infrastructure systems collapse.</p>
<p>Though the National Guard was deployed before the storm even hit, there is simply no way for the government to coordinate a response requiring millions of servings of food, water and medical supplies</p>
<p>Many east coast residents who failed to evacuate or prepare reserve supplies ahead of the storm are being forced to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>Frustration and anger have taken hold, as residents have no means of acquiring food or gas and thousands of trucks across the region remain <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/31/hurricane-sandy-disrupts-food-distribution_n_2049778.html" target="_blank">stuck in limbo</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Legends from the past? Every single extreme weather event in recent years in the United States has been followed by looting.</p>

<h2>Does this sound familiar?</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">This revision of inconvenient history will sound quite familiar to anyone who has read George Orwell&#8217;s masterpiece </span><em style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">1984 </em><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">(which was not meant to be an instruction manual, by the way.)  In the novel, the main character, Winston Smith, worked for the Ministry of Truth, which was actually a department of propaganda whose job it was to rewrite any faction of history that did not make the government look omniscient.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>In <a title="George Orwell" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell">George Orwell</a>&#8216;s novel <i><a title="Nineteen Eighty-Four" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a></i>, the <b>Ministry of Truth</b> is <a title="Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nations_of_Nineteen_Eighty-Four#Oceania">Oceania</a>&#8216;s <a title="Propaganda" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda">propaganda</a> ministry. It is responsible for any necessary falsification of historical events. The word <i>truth</i> in the title <i>Ministry of Truth</i> should warn, by definition, that the &#8220;minister&#8221; will self-serve its own &#8220;truth&#8221;; the title implies the willful fooling of posterity using &#8220;historical&#8221; archives to show &#8220;in fact&#8221; what &#8220;really&#8221; happened. As well as administering truth, the ministry spreads a new language amongst the populace called <a title="Newspeak" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak">Newspeak</a>, in which, for example, <i>truth</i> is understood to mean statements like <a title="2 + 2 = 5" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_%2B_2_%3D_5">2 + 2 = 5</a> when the situation warrants.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Truth is involved with news media, entertainment, the fine arts and educational books. Its purpose is to rewrite history to change the facts to fit Party doctrine for <a title="Propaganda" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda">propaganda</a> effect. For example, if <a title="Big Brother (1984)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(1984)">Big Brother</a> makes a prediction that turns out to be wrong, the employees of the Ministry of Truth go back and rewrite the prediction so that any prediction Big Brother previously made is accurate. This is the &#8220;how&#8221; of the Ministry of Truth&#8217;s existence. Within the novel, Orwell elaborates that the deeper reason for its existence is to maintain the illusion that the Party is absolute. It cannot ever seem to change its mind (if, for instance, they perform one of their constant changes regarding enemies during war) or make a mistake (firing an official or making a grossly misjudged supply prediction), for that would imply weakness and to maintain power the Party must seem eternally right and strong. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Truth" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<h2>But&#8230;.WHY????</h2>
<p>So why the vast effort to expunge tales of mayhem and to make it seem like our own national disasters really weren&#8217;t that bad?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple. Those who live a self-sufficient lifestyle are a threat to the status quo that those in power would like to see.  If you don&#8217;t NEED them, then there is no leverage to force you into compliance.  You don&#8217;t NEED to go to Camp FEMA in order to have 3 squares a day.  You don&#8217;t NEED to give up your guns in order to have a roof over your head and government supplied security.  You don&#8217;t NEED to get some kind of chip implanted in your arm to be scanned in order to receive &#8220;benefits&#8221; like medical care, food, and even money.</p>
<p>Self-sufficiency <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/how-many-buckets-of-freedom-do-you-have-02252013" target="_blank">means freedom</a>.  When you can feed yourself, clothe yourself, shelter yourself, and protect yourself, you are far less likely to need to cede your freedoms  in order to stay alive. And in a police state that is frantically trying to withdraw our constitutional rights, this just won&#8217;t do.  They need leverage.</p>
<p>So the establishment has created a narrative that tells us what we are doing is silly and unnecessary.  They are rewriting history even though we only lived that history in the past decade.  Even though we know the truth of the matter because we watched it live, they are changing the facts to make us doubt our own perceptions.</p>
<p>This narrative was created to make a society of anti-preppers &#8211; of people who believe that all will be right with the world, the government is kind and benevolent, potential disasters aren&#8217;t really that big of a deal, and that preppers are stark raving lunatics.  They want us to be perceived as extremists so that others are less likely to follow our examples. If they need a crazy bad guy at whom to point the finger, all they have to do is call someone a &#8220;Doomsday Prepper&#8221;. (Remember how poor <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/the-psy-ops-war-on-preppers-12172012" target="_blank">Nancy Lanza was vilified</a> after the Sandy Hook shooting last year?)</p>
<p>If this civil unrest is not occurring, why is the National Guard called to keep the peace?  Why are state police riding around on tanks wearing body armor? Why were the guns of law-abiding citizens taken away in the aftermath of Katrina?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>My family and I have opted to be prepared with food, water, a self-defense strategy, and home security.  We believe that when bad things happen, worse things often follow before order is restored.  We won&#8217;t be lining up to get an MRE and a bottle of water to share amongst us. We won&#8217;t require a cot at Camp FEMA.  We won&#8217;t need to give up our firearms in order to get our next meal.</p>
<p>Which reality are you going to believe?  The one that you witnessed or the perverted rewrite that the mainstream media is trying to push upon you for the benefit of their handlers?</p>

<p>A man incited Chaos at a drunk driving checkpoint in Pennsylvania and is facing up to 7 years in prison for the felony.</p>
<p>Chaos, however, is a dog.</p>
<p>26 year old James Paul Andrews has been charged with &#8220;inciting chaos&#8221; at a checkpoint in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania by &#8220;barking, hissing and growling” and a K-9 named, well, Chaos.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Butler Eagle reports Cranberry Township police filed the charge on Monday – which is a felony carrying up to seven years in prison – along with drunken driving and other charges.</p>
<p>Township Sgt. Chuck Mascellino says Myers and Chaos were assisting with the checkpoint when Andrews allegedly became irritated and began barking at the dog.  (<a href="http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2013/09/25/butler-co-man-charged-after-barking-at-k-9-at-dui-checkpoint/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>The private prison business in the United States is booming because of silly charges like this.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just look at what has happened to the U.S. prison population over the past several decades.  Prior to 1980, there were virtually no private prisons in the United States.  But since that time, we have seen the overall prison population and the private prison population absolutely explode.</p>
<p>For example, between 1990 and 2009 the number of Americans in private prisons grew by about <a title="1600 percent" href="http://www.salon.com/2011/12/01/how_private_prisons_game_the_system/" target="_blank">1600 percent</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, the U.S. prison population <a title="more than quadrupled" href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/157536-private-prisons-a-reliable-american-growth-industry" target="_blank">more than quadrupled</a> between 1980 and 2007. (<a href=" http://www.thedailysheeple.com/private-prisons-the-more-americans-they-put-behind-bars-the-more-money-they-make_032013#sthash.saay4NKK.dpuf" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>(Meanwhile, Nobel Peace Prize winning President Obama continues to drone children, yet, ironically, he remains free.)</p>
<p>When they aren&#8217;t busy trashing the Constitution, police departments have become little more than revenue generators, writing tickets, filling quotas, and enforcing meaningless regulations.  Will you be the next victim of this &#8220;for-profit&#8221; policing?

<p>As I write this, it appears that the federal government is about to shut down because the House and Senate cannot agree on whether to add language defunding or delaying Obamacare to the “Continuing Resolution”. Despite all the hand-wringing heard in DC, a short-term government shut down (which doesn’t actually shut down the government) will not cause the country to collapse.</p>
<p>And the American people would benefit if Obamacare was defeated or even delayed.</p>
<p>Obamacare saddles the American health care system with new spending and mandates which will raise the price and lower the quality of health care. Denying funds to this program may give Congress time to replace this bill with free-market reforms that put patients and physicians back in charge of health care. Defunding the bill before it becomes implemented can spare the American people from falling under the worst effects of this law.</p>
<p>As heartened as we should be by the fight against Obamacare, we should be equally disheartened by the fact that so few in DC are talking about making real cuts in federal spending. Even fewer are talking about reductions in the most logical place to reduce spending: the military-industrial complex.  The US military budget constitutes almost 50 percent of the total worldwide military spending.  Yet to listen to some in Congress, one would think that America was one canceled multi-million dollar helicopter contract away from being left totally defenseless.</p>
<p>What makes this military spending impossible to justify is that is does not benefit the American people. Instead, by fomenting resentment and hatred among the world population, our costly interventionist foreign policy makes our people less safe. Thus, reducing spending on militarism would not only help balance the budget, but would enhance our security.</p>
<p>Yet both the House and the Senate continuing resolutions not only fail to reduce military spending, they actually authorize $20 billion more in military spending than authorized by the “sequestration” created by the 2011 Budget Control Act.  Most of the supposedly “draconian” sequestration cuts are not even cuts; instead, they are &#8220;reductions in the planed rate of spending.” This is where Congress increases spending but by less than originally planned—and yet they claim to cut spending.</p>
<p>Under sequestration, military spending increases by 18 percent instead of by 20 percent over the next ten years. Yet some so-called conservatives are so opposed to these phony cuts in military spending that they would support increased taxes and increased welfare “military” spending. This “grand bargain” would benefit the DC political class and the special interests, but it would be a disaster for the American people.</p>
<p>Instead of grand bargains of increased spending and taxes, those of us who support limited government and free markets should form a coalition with antiwar liberals to reduce spending on both the military industrial complex and domestic welfare programs. Instead of raising taxes on “the rich” we should also work to reduce all corporate subsidies. This “grand bargain” would truly be a win-win for the American people.</p>
<p>Sadly, even if a congressional coalition to cut both warfare and welfare spending was formed, it would be unlikely to carry the day as long as the Federal Reserve is willing to enable Congress’s debt addiction by monetizing the debt. But this cannot last forever. At some point the Fed’s policies will result in hyper-inflation and an economic crisis that will force Congress to reduce spending. Hopefully, the growing number of Americans who are awaking to the dangers of our current path can convince Congress to reduce overseas militarism and begin an orderly drawdown of the welfare state before this crisis occurs.

<p>Deadlocked…and yet the Senate was too preoccupied to come back on Sunday and do their job of working on behalf of the American people…a job they were elected to do.Waiting until 2 pm this afternoon to return to session…a mere 10 hours before a possible government shutdown begins…Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had the audacity to tell ‘We the People’ that the Democratic majority Senate will reject the new House compromise bill even BEFORE any Senators see or read it.</p>
<p>Talk about partisan rhetoric, liberal whining, and foot stomping when he does NOT get his way…now add in a dose of Nancy Pelosi’s ‘you have to pass it before you can read it’ rantings and Harry Reid’s true motives become obvious…the same anti-American motives as Barack HUSSEIN Obama has.</p>
<p>“The American people will not be extorted by Tea Party anarchists” whined Reid as the reason why the Senate will NOT approve the House bill…a bill that keeps the government up and running after the October 1st date when we &#8216;supposedly&#8217; run out of money, while at the same time delaying the dreaded ObamaCare for one year.</p>
<p>&#8216;Extorted by Tea Party anarchists&#8217;&#8230;NO..I don&#8217;t think so for the Tea Party is comprised of true American patriots…something Reid knows NOTHING about. And what Reid does NOT understand or simply refuses to understand is that the reason the House will NEVER approve any Senate bill as long as the monstrosity known as ObamaCare remains in its current form is that 57+% of the American people do NOT want it at all…meaning the House is voting according to the will of the people…something the Senate and Harry Reid refuse to do.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--dU4KF6cmys/Ukjfy7hiUiI/AAAAAAAAJFU/xx22oAQL2Gs/s1600/capital+at+nite.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--dU4KF6cmys/Ukjfy7hiUiI/AAAAAAAAJFU/xx22oAQL2Gs/s200/capital+at+nite.jpg" width="200" height="107" border="0" /></a>And so thankfully, the House Republicans did NOT back down and in a rare Saturday night session they stood strong and united against the Senate bill, voting 231-192 in favor of a one year delay of ObamaCare, and by a margin of 248-174 they voted to repeal the medical device tax, with 17 Democrats voting along with the Republicans on this section. And this was nice to see after 23 Republican Senators went RINO on us during the previous round of Senate voting.</p>
<p>And when the night was over ALL 229 Republicans…along with two Democrats (Rep.McIntyre-NC and Rep. Matheson-UT)&#8230;passed a second continuing resolution…a short-term stop-gap measure really…but one that would avoid an early Tuesday morning government shutdown.</p>
<p>But now showing what a narrow-minded uncompromising individual he really is…just like his buddy Obama…Harry Reid has rejected the new House bill outright BEFORE it even reaches the Senate floor…rejecting a bill that is a good meld and compromise between what the Republicans want and what the Democrats want as it funds the government through December 15th yet delays…NOT defunds…the implementation of ObamaCare for one year.</p>
<p>And delaying ObamaCare for one year is especially important in light of the fact that Obama himself delayed it for one year for BIG business (in fact Obama has signed seven bills to change provisions in the original ObamaCare)…so in all fairness it should be delayed one year across the board for the American people as well. But ‘Prince’ Harry obviously does NOT understand the rules of fair play nor is he even willing to address compromise.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0zeHP7p_C3U/UkjdtfUZ5TI/AAAAAAAAJFM/O-93qOTROUI/s1600/harry+reid.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0zeHP7p_C3U/UkjdtfUZ5TI/AAAAAAAAJFM/O-93qOTROUI/s200/harry+reid.jpg" width="200" height="132" border="0" /></a>“After weeks of futile political games from Republicans, we are still at square one,” Reid whined after the House vote was announced, but in reality ALL delays have come from the Democratic side. And to make this forthcoming NO vote in the Senate even more grievous is that in addition to the delaying of ObamaCare by one year, in a separate but attached bill the Republican proposal included wording to the affect that in the event of a government shutdown that our military must still get paid…and Harry Reid being the true liberal that he is says that will be rejected by the Senate also.</p>
<p>So while it’s nice to know that Reid knows the Senate vote even BEFORE they do, his total rejection of continuing paychecks for our military…agreed to in a unanimous House vote…shows his true character and dislike for those who defend our country…again just like Barack HUSSEIN Obama does</p>
<p>And we all know that these marching orders NOT to even consider let alone compromise on the new House bill come directly from Barack HUSSEIN Obama himself…from the very man who has NO trouble talking to and compromising with our enemies…but then again in his eyes ‘We the People’ are the enemies…the enemies of his socialist agenda and the enemy of his blood brethren.</p>
<p>And so this afternoon when the Senate rejects the House short-term stop-gap bill, we know the in-the-pocket-for-Obama media will blame the Republicans for the sure to follow first government shutdown in nearly 20 years, even while the House immediately moves to construct and pass another bill that would challenge ObamaCare.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ql6338tEFl4/UkjgvVckcQI/AAAAAAAAJFc/hHdsD8ttARI/s1600/shut+down.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ql6338tEFl4/UkjgvVckcQI/AAAAAAAAJFc/hHdsD8ttARI/s200/shut+down.jpg" width="200" height="150" border="0" /></a>So let the shutdown begin…in fact it’s most welcomed for in reality it will take a government shutdown…NOT just the threat of a shutdown…to get Barack HUSSEIN Obama and Harry Reid down from their media appointed pedestals and force them to the negotiating table where they will have to take the Republicans seriously while the Republicans work to clean-up Obama and Reid’s economic mess.</p>
<p>And what’s truly sad is that in today’s America real policy discussion and negotiation can only happen when both sides are forced to the table because both sides have much to lose.

<p style="text-align: left;">International media picks up on exclusive high level military intelligence that alerted us to a secret nuke transfer among warnings of a nuclear strike by Senator Lindsey Graham later on the same day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/YxG2OssXERk" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>I recently joined The Truthseeker program, which reaches 85 million homes in the United States alone, to discuss the <a href="http://www.infowars.com/exclusive-high-level-source-confirms-secret-us-nuclear-warhead-transfer-to-east-coast/" target="_blank">exclusive high level intelligence</a> reported on by Alex Jones and I regarding the secret transfer of nuclear warheads from Texas to South Carolina. Specifically, I honed in on the fact that Senator Lindsey Graham warned just hours after the leak that a ‘nuclear strike’ could actually hit South Carolina in the event that the US did not initiate a war with Syria.</p>
<p>Viewed by millions on both Infowars and Storyleak, the pieces we wrote on the issue also led us to launch a number of videos that have accumulated hundreds of thousands of views in a very short period of time as well as having invoked a major response from concerned citizens and military alike. So much so that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeinDCH6TUE" target="_blank">I was able to receive</a> an official military response in regards to the missing nuke despite the claims by personnel that it was ‘strictly against policy’ to comment on the issue.</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from the original article on the high level missing nuke intelligence now being picked up by the media:</p>
<p>“A high level source inside the military has now confirmed to us that Dyess Air Force base is actively moving nuclear warheads to the East Coast of the United States in a secret transfer that has no paper trail.  The brief report from the top level military source, which was written in a rush to get the information out, reads:</p>
<p>‘Dyess is beginning to move out nuclear war heads today. I got a tap from DERMO earlier. He said it was the first time they have been even acknowledged since being put there in the 80′s. <strong>No signature was required for transfer… There was no directive</strong>. He said that <strong>Dyess Commander was on site to give authority to release</strong>. No one knew where they were going really, but <strong>the truck driver said to take them to South Carolina and another pick up will take them from there</strong>.’”</p>

<h3>Government Blurs the Lines Between Bad Guys and Average Americans</h3>
<p><em>Preface: Whether you believe this is a conspiracy by the government – or just over-reaction, incompetence or cronyism – the end result is idiotic … and <a title="counter-productive" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/08/top-security-expert-treating-everyone-like-a-potential-terrorist-weakens-our-ability-to-protect-america.html" target="_blank">counter-productive</a>.</em></p>
<p>Former NSA boss Michael Hayden <a title="compared privacy advocates to terrorists" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/06/nsa-director-cyber-terrorism-snowden?CMP=twt_gu" target="_blank">compared privacy advocates to terrorists</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If and when our government grabs Edward Snowden, and brings him back here to the United States for trial, what does this group do?” said retired air force general Michael Hayden, who from 1999 to 2009 ran the NSA and then the CIA, referring to “nihilists, anarchists, activists, Lulzsec, Anonymous, twentysomethings who haven’t talked to the opposite sex in five or six years”.</p>
<p>“They may want to come after the US government, but frankly, you know, the dot-mil stuff is about the hardest target in the United States,” Hayden said, using a shorthand for US military networks. “So if they can’t create great harm to dot-mil, who are they going after? Who for them are the World Trade Centers? The World Trade Centers, as they were for al-Qaida.”</p>
<p>Hayden provided his speculation during a speech on cybersecurity to a Washington group, the Bipartisan Policy Center, in which he confessed to being deliberately provocative.</p></blockquote>
<p>Similarly, Slate <a title="reported" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/02/02/communities_against_terrorism_initiative_on_internet_cafes_.html" target="_blank">reported</a> last year:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>If you’ve ever cared about privacy while using the Internet in public, you might be a terrorist. At least that’s the message from the FBI and Justice Department’s Communities Against Terrorism initiative. The project created flyers to help employees at several types of businesses—including military surplus stores, financial institutions, and even tattoo shops—recognize “warning signs” of terrorism or extremism. An admirable goal, perhaps, but the execution is flawed—particularly for the flyers intended to help suss out terrorists using Internet cafes.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The flyers haven’t been publicly available online, but Public Intelligence, a project promoting the right to access information, <a title="collected 25 documents" href="https://www.slatt.org/CAT" target="_blank">collected 25 documents</a> that it found elsewhere on the Web. As Public Intelligence <a title="puts it" href="http://publicintelligence.net/do-you-like-online-privacy-you-may-be-a-terrorist/" target="_blank">puts it</a>, “Do you like online privacy? You may be a terrorist.”</p>

<p>More than a decade ago I had a party, it was August and for once we were having a relatively decent summer. I was working at a major London hospital, one of my transient stopovers in my work as an agency operating theatre practitioner. We had decided to celebrate my birthday.</p>
<p>Now moving around all the time makes you way more money than staying in one hospital and slugging your guts out working for the NHS (National Health Service), but the downside is that you never really make close friends. In addition,the shift system makes it difficult to arrange such events as someone you want to come is always working. So, I put a notice on the board that read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lizzie is having an impromptu birthday party. Due to shift constraints feel free to come and go as required anytime from 12 noon. Party ends when the last guest leaves. We have several BBQ&#8217;s catering for carnivores, Halal carnivores, Kosher carnivores and veg heads. If this doesn&#8217;t cover you, bring a disposable BBQ and something to throw on it. <strong>ANYONE discussing religion or politics will be physically thrown out of the house</strong>. National dress would be wonderful, otherwise anything is acceptable. Liz.</p></blockquote>
<p>As you may have guessed the hospital was very mixed bag of people with almost all nationalities represented. At one minute past noon the first guest arrived, a Hindu doctor with a bag full of wonderfully exotic veggies. She apologised for her plastic surgeon husband&#8230;a kid with a facial dog bite would see him working for several more hours.  By 2pm the garden was full of  happy chatting people, many in national dress, or national colours, it was wonderful.</p>
<p>People came and went throughout the day and into the night, the last guest leaving at 0500, well so we thought until we found one on the sofa, sound asleep, his jacket used as a blanket. It was a really wonderful day and will stick with me forever. 19 nationalities came to my home that day. People ranging from a hospital porter to an internationally renowned cardiac surgeon and pretty much everything in between.</p>
<p>Of course some people avoided certain other people but it was done quietly and attending family members never even noticed. To see toddlers from opposing &#8216;sides&#8217; chasing each other around and sharing toys was magical, and when one tumbled, its parent out of reach the &#8216;opposing&#8217; parent picked her up, dusted her off and returned her to her father. The men, whose countries were bitter enemies shook hands. Not usually given to emotion I felt like crying&#8230;could have been the drink I suppose.</p>
<p>You can imagine my surprise, and horror, when a couple of weeks later a documentary about muslim extremism in the UK was aired on television and one of the doctors who had spent hours in my home was seen, and heard voicing his opinion of the UK and the British people. Secret filming  inside the mosque filmed the preachers, and the congregation.</p>
<p>This man, whose last child I had helped into the world, at his request might I add, was praying for the death of the Kufar (non-believers) via holy jihad. This man, whose home I had visited with flowers for his wife and gifts for the baby regarded me, and all other British women as a &#8216;dirty kufar whores&#8217;</p>
<p>Within minutes the phone started ringing, colleagues who were watching the same programme. Like me they were experiencing utter disbelief at what they were seeing. Yet there it was, on the television. He was not being coerced, threatened, nothing. The words coming out of his mouth were his alone.</p>
<p>I watched, for an hour, as he and others with similar opinions slated the country that they now lived in, the country that educated their children, gave them jobs. I listened as he talked of jihad, holy war and how he would happily martyr himself for the cause at the first available opportunity. I felt sick, genuinely physically sick.</p>
<p>I went into work extra early the next day. Walked into the doctors changing room alongside another guy with the same idea. Our now ex-colleague was clearing out his locker, flanked by two uniformed police officers and a senior hospital manager. Mike the guy with me asked him why. The answer was not verbal. The doctor spat in his face. Our colleague, our friend, the man who we shared food with, tended patients with, spat in Mikes face.</p>
<p>Our cases were delayed that day as we re-jigged the list borrowing anaesthetists to fill the gap that his departure had left. All the patients were treated, but the mood was sombre, quiet, as we all considered the implications of what had happened.</p>
<p>Other muslim doctors, and nurses were quick to condemn him. They tried so hard to convince us that they were okay, they didn&#8217;t have the same opinions, but it never really worked. If this guy, one of the longest serving anaesthetists and regular on the dinner and party list could feel like this&#8230;well putting it bluntly, so could they.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, sitting in the staff coffee lounge a few of us were trying to summon up the energy to go home after one of the worst night shifts I can remember. Someone flicked on the television. We thought it was a disaster movie as we saw a plane fly right into the side of the World Trade centre. We changed the channel and the same movie was on, we changed the channel again&#8230;it was September 11th 2001.</p>
<p>Calls were made, the word spread. As operations finished the next patients were not sent for, the room filled with hospital staff. It was quiet, so quiet, the room could have been empty. After a couple of minutes muttered prayers were whispered by the devout of a dozen different religions. A very mild mannered, very tiny little nurse shot across the room, grabbed a female gynaecologist by the throat screaming and shouting at her in a language we didn&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>The gynaecologist was giving praise to Allah, praying that her brothers would enjoy everlasting peace and that their martyrdom would be copied by those who came after them.</p>
<p>Aisha, the nurse was an ex-muslim. She spoke English with a French accent, she had been born there. She fled France after two attempts on her life. Her father and one of her brothers said she had dishonoured the family by refusing to go through with an arranged marriage. she still bore the burn scars of one of the attacks. Borrowing money from friends she went to Calais, got on a Eurostar train and never looked back. The friends were told she was going to more moderate relatives in Germany. At 17 she arrived in the UK with a backpack and £15. A couple of years later she fell in love with a bricklayer, married him  and with his help erased as many links to her past as possible.</p>
<p>As you can imagine we used Aisha as our teacher, she was bombarded with questions for weeks and answered them all to the best of her ability.</p>
<p>So many of her words have stayed with me in the intervening years, but none more than what she said about martyrdom.</p>
<p>She explained that those who commit these acts want to die. They actually want to die so that they can sit with Allah and be revered for all time.</p>
<p>The worst punishment that these men and women can have is failure, failure to achieve the state of martyrdom. Committing the most heinous of crimes is not enough to ensure they sit with Allah, the proof of their love for him, their loyalty to him is to die for him whilst in battle with the enemies of Allah, the enemies of Islam.</p>
<p>Nidal Hasan has committed mass murder. What to some makes it worse than other  mass shootings is that Hasan was a doctor, a man trained to heal. In addition, he was a member of the US military and murdered his comrades. What has to happen for Hasan to become a martyr is that he dies for what he did. Execution for his crimes will count, it will do just nicely. Only death brought about by his crime will secure his place at Allah&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>Paralysed during the incident and demanding to wear the beard required by his religion Hasan has been sentenced to death. He will be pleased about this. It&#8217;s difficult for those of us who believe that life is sacrosanct to get our heads around this, but it&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>
<p>Anyone who dies during jihad is getting their most desired wish. Locking them up and throwing away the key prevents them from being referred to as a martyr for all time. Their names will not be muttered in the revered tone saved for such people. They will not sit with Allah, they will not be a martyr, and they will be regarded as having failed to complete their mission.</p>
<p>Nidal Hasan, should in my opinion spend the rest of his life in solitary confinement in his wheelchair, his chin shaved pondering what he&#8217;s done,. To sit there, for years, deprived of the one thing he craves , his only reading material a copy of  The Quran, will be hell on Earth for him. His holy book will be a constant reminder of how he failed by surviving. It will irritate him, cause him mental anguish and despair. He should be reminded on a daily basis that he will not sit on the right hand of his god, that he failed, that he will never enter into martyrdom.</p>
<p>He will spend his days thinking  of the martyrs who went before him, those who succeeded where he failed. He will be filled with self loathing that he cannot join them. Such is his faith and his belief in Islam.</p>
<p>Executing this man will cause rejoicing amongst jihadist groups around the world. They will hold his picture aloft and bow down in front of it, they will burn the American flag at the same time as praising Allah for providing a way for this wonderful man to get into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>Execution holds no fear for him. He wants it, he craves it, he actually NEEDS it to get where he wants to be. For the sake of the men and women who died at Fort Hood, in their memory, cut off the head of the beast, the time has come to stop feeding the monsters in our midst. Anyone who commits such atrocities in the name of a god, any god should be deprived of what they want most.</p>
<p>Those who die in these attacks wanted to live, their strongest desire was taken from them. We have to do the same to the extremists, any extremists of any religion, creed or colour. We have to stop feeding them. We have to stop giving them what they want. We have to deny them the chance of martyrdom whenever possible.</p>
<p>Take Care</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Since 2010, the NSA has been gathering that social networking data on Americans and compiling it into intricate graphs like this one:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/nsa-the-involuntary-social-network_092013/graphs" rel="attachment wp-att-58836"><img class="wp-image-58836 aligncenter" alt="graphs" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/graphs.png" width="436" height="327" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/nsa-examines-social-networks-of-us-citizens.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">James Risen and Laura Poitras of </a><em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/nsa-examines-social-networks-of-us-citizens.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">The New York Times:<br />
</a></em></p>
<blockquote><p>The agency can augment the communications data with material from public, commercial and other sources, including bank codes, insurance information, Facebook profiles, passenger manifests, voter registration rolls and GPS location information, as well as property records and unspecified tax data, according to the documents. They do not indicate any restrictions on the use of such “enrichment” data, and several former senior Obama administration officials said the agency drew on it for both Americans and foreigners.</p></blockquote>
<p>There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any restriction on the types of data collected &#8211; or from whom it is collected. This network is supposed to be used to track the data of foreign nationals, but Americans can get tangled in the web if they are linked to a suspect&#8217;s social connections.</p>
<p>An NSA spokeswoman <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/nsa-examines-social-networks-of-us-citizens.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">explained</a> how this can happen:</p>
<blockquote><p>The legal underpinning of the policy change was a 1979 Supreme Court ruling that Americans could have no expectation of privacy about what numbers they had called. Based on that ruling, the Justice Department and the Pentagon decided that it was permissible to create contact chains using Americans’ “metadata,” which includes the timing, location and other details of calls and e-mails, but not their content. The agency is not required to seek warrants for the analyses from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.</p></blockquote>
<p>PowerPoint presentations and memos from the agency detail how the NSA has been able to develop software and other tools to reveal as much information about individuals as possible. One document cited a new generation of programs that “revolutionize” data collection and analysis.</p>
<p>Some facts about this newly-revealed spying program:</p>
<p>1) The NSA is developing a &#8220;metadata repository&#8221; that can take in 20 BILLION &#8220;record events&#8221; every DAY &#8211; and this information will be available to analysts within an hour, according to a 2013 budget document disclosed by Snowden.</p>
<p>2) There are multiple collection programs and databases, and they rely on both domestic and international metadata.</p>
<p>3) One of the main tools used for &#8220;chaining&#8221; phone and email records is called Mainway. Significant amounts of data originating in the United States goes into this system.</p>
<p>4) An internal NSA bulletin stated that Mainway was taking in 700 million phone records per day. In August 2011, it began receiving an additional 1.1 billion cellphone records <strong>daily</strong> from an <em>unnamed American service provider</em> under Section 702 of the 2008 FISA Amendments Act, which allows for the collection of the data of Americans if at least one end of the communication is believed to be foreign.</p>
<p>5) Budget documents revealed by Snowden show that the NSA is putting a lot of effort and money into &#8220;creating a metadata repository capable of taking in 20 billion “record events” daily and making them available to NSA analysts within 60 minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>6)  The budget includes $394 million for an “Enterprise Knowledge System,” which is designed to “rapidly discover and correlate complex relationships and patterns across diverse data sources on a massive scale,” according to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/nsa-examines-social-networks-of-us-citizens.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">2008 document</a>. This data is automatically computed to hasten queries and <strong>discover new targets for surveillance</strong>.</p>
<p>7) “Better Person Centric Analysis” is a top-secret document that describes how the agency searches for 94 “entity types,” including phone numbers, e-mail addresses and IP addresses. In addition, the NSA correlates 164 “relationship types” to build social networks and what the agency calls “community of interest” profiles, using queries like “travelsWith, hasFather, sentForumMessage, employs.&#8221;</p>
<p>8) An internal briefing paper from the NSA Office of Legal Counsel showed that the agency was allowed to collect and retain metadata and content about “U.S. persons” for up to five years online and for an additional 10 years offline for “historical searches.”</p>
<p>Orin S. Kerr, a law professor at George Washington University, told the <em>New York Times</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Metadata can be very revealing. Knowing things like the number someone just dialed or the location of the person’s cellphone is going to allow to assemble a picture of what someone is up to. It’s the digital equivalent of tailing a suspect.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In essence, the government is building a detailed database of our daily lives.</p>
<p>But they are just looking out for our best interests, right?

<p style="text-align: center;">By J. D. Heyes</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Less than a week before the &#8220;official&#8221; roll-out of Obamacare and the system is in a shambles.</p>
<p>Americans remain fearful and confused about the new law. Benefits and pricing still hasn&#8217;t been worked out. And worse, some of the state and territorial exchanges called for under the law are already on life support.</p>
<p>Can you say, &#8220;Epic fail?&#8221;</p>
<p>Per the <i>Washington Post</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just days away from launch, the District of Columbia&#8217;s health marketplace is announcing a pretty significant delay.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While the D.C. Health Link will launch a Web site on October 1, shoppers will not have access to the their premium prices until mid-November. The delay comes after the District marketplace discovered &#8220;a high error rate&#8221; in calculating the tax credits that low- and middle-income people will use to purchase insurance on the marketplace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">The nation&#8217;s capital, perhaps the most liberal &#8220;progressive&#8221; place in the entire country, has been increasingly fearful of Obamacare&#8217;s disastrous effects in the months and weeks leading up to the official launch. Huge amounts of unionized federal workers have rejected the law that Obama has <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/040204_obamacare_exemptions_congress_affordable_care_act.html" target="_blank">exempted lawmakers from</a>. The IRS&#8217;s own union &#8211; members of the agency charged with <i>enforcing</i> Obamacare&#8217;s myriad of rules, regulations, mandates and penalties &#8211; <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/041426_obamacare_irs_employees_union.html" target="_blank">doesn&#8217;t want the law</a>.</p>
<p>Now, as the start date for the law approaches, many of the government-run health insurance exchanges called for under the &#8220;Affordable&#8221; Care Act are either not ready for prime time or are too broken to function.</p>
<p>And it is as appropriate as it is ironic that the exchange in the nation&#8217;s capital is one of the first to break.</p>
<p>As reported by the Post, the insurance exchanges &#8211; according to plan &#8211; were supposed to be capable of providing estimates for tax credits after a &#8220;shopper&#8221; puts in some basic info about where he or she lives and how much he or she earns (already, as you can see, <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/Obamacare.html" target="_blank">Obamacare</a> demands info you shouldn&#8217;t have to provide the <i>government</i> just to purchase health insurance!).</p>
<p>But, in D.C. at least, that&#8217;s not going to happen at least until next month. And perhaps longer.</p>
<p>Instead, the paper reported, determinations of eligibility will be made &#8220;offline&#8221; by early November.</p>
<p>More from the Post:</p>
<blockquote><p>The delay will be less significant for people who likely qualify for Medicaid in the District, which covers everyone below 200 percent of the poverty line (about $22,000 for an individual). In cases where someone is found likely eligible for that program, D.C. Health Link spokesman Richard Sorian said they should get a determination with 24 hours.</p></blockquote>
<p>The plan is to ensure that Medicaid enrollees &#8211; who, of course, qualify automatically and <i>immediately</i> for still more taxpayer-provided benefits under Obamacare &#8211; are processed the fastest.</p>
<p>Working stiffs &#8211; people who might qualify for tax credits &#8211; will have to wait until January, again at the earliest.</p>
<p><b>Still think the government can get this right?</b></p>
<p>D.C. Healthlink, the name of Washington&#8217;s insurance exchange, put out this announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>DC Health Link is not currently deploying the function that makes new Medicaid eligibility determinations and calculates tax credits for purchase of private insurance due to a high error rate discovered through extensive systems testing.</p></blockquote>
<p>People seeking Medicaid coverage or tax credits will be able to use DC Health Link to create an account and submit an on-line application.</p>
<p>The Post notes, &#8220;This certainly is not good news for Obamacare, especially in the wake of the other reports on similar glitches at the federal level. The <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/Obama.html">Obama</a> administration has repeatedly promised that, starting on October 1, all Americans will be able to purchase insurance coverage on the new marketplaces.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, it&#8217;s not good news for <i>American insurance consumers</i>. We&#8217;ve been reporting for years that this law is, and will continue to be, an unmitigated, bureaucratic nightmare disaster. That it&#8217;s launch is already so screwed up &#8211; after <i>a two-year lead time</i> &#8211; should tell you all you need to know about how the rest of this will turn out.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">By <span class="author">Dean Garrison</span></p>
<p>Earlier this week The D.C. Clothesline featured an article titled <a href="http://dcclothesline.com/2013/09/26/pentagon-orders-purge-of-osama-bin-ladens-death-files-from-data-bank/" target="_blank">Pentagon Orders Purge of Osama Bin Laden’s Death Files from Data Bank</a> by Professor Michel Chossudovsky of Global Research. Running articles like that elicit the typical and predictable responses. A lot of people question the Osama Bin Laden narrative for many reasons, but some just accuse us of tabloid news and brush off The D.C. Clothesline as a blog that some nutjob runs from his home. Those same people will throw “Snopes” articles at me on occasion, which I find ironic since Snopes is run by a couple from their home.</p>
<p>What kind of logic is that?</p>
<p>I am not the only truth seeking blogger to share in the frustration of putting out important stories that are ignored. There is a continual frustration of digging up stories that need to be exposed by the mainstream media and we can’t even get the larger right-wing sources to pick up some of the very important stories. So when someone with a respected resume starts to talk about some of the same things we are, there is a natural feeling of vindication.</p>
<p>Seymour Hersh won the Pulitzer Prize in 1970 for exposing the My Lai Massacre. He is a 5-time winner of the prestigious Polk Award (1969, 1973, 1974, 1981, 2004). He also earned the George Orwell Award in 2004. In 2004 he exposed the mistreatment of prisoners of war by the U.S. Military at Abu Graib prison.</p>
<p>This man has credentials. Perhaps his biggest credential is his obvious willingness to go after democrats or republicans. He was once described by the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2013/sep/27/seymour-hersh-obama-nsa-american-media" target="_blank">Republican party as “the closest thing American journalism has to a terrorist.”</a></p>
<p>So if this 7-time winner of major awards in the field of journalism, who has shown no mercy to republicans in the past, shines light on the Bin Laden narrative, perhaps we should listen.</p>
<p>There are too many things that don’t add up like the picture of the situation room that has been judged in some circles to be a photoshopped fake, the <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/08/extortion-17-is-a-bigger-scandal-and-betrayal-than-benghazi/" target="_blank">deaths of so many of our American heroes who allegedy took place in the Bin Laden raid</a>, the unconventional “burial at sea,” and the fact that <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/08/reggie-love-obama-played-cards-during-bin-laden-raid-because-he-didnt-want-to-watch-this-entire-thing/" target="_blank">Reggie Love claims Obama was playing spades with him during the raid</a>.</p>
<p>Some things simply do not add up. Seymour Hersh has had enough of gutless journalists and corrupt officials in D.C.</p>
<p>The Guardian <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2013/sep/27/seymour-hersh-obama-nsa-american-media" target="_blank">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>He is angry about the timidity of journalists in America, their failure to challenge the White House and be an unpopular messenger of truth.</p>
<p>Don’t even get him started on the New York Times which, he says, spends “so much more time carrying water for Obama than I ever thought they would” – or the death of Osama bin Laden. “Nothing’s been done about that story, it’s one big lie, not one word of it is true,” he says of the dramatic US Navy Seals raid in 2011.</p>
<p>Hersh is writing a book about national security and has devoted a chapter to the bin Laden killing. He says a recent report put out by an “independent” Pakistani commission about life in the Abottabad compound in which Bin Laden was holed up would not stand up to scrutiny. “The Pakistanis put out a report, don’t get me going on it. Let’s put it this way, it was done with considerable American input. It’s a bullshit report,” he says hinting of revelations to come in his book.</p>
<p>The Obama administration lies systematically, he claims, yet none of the leviathans of American media, the TV networks or big print titles, challenge him.</p>
<p>“It’s pathetic, they are more than obsequious, they are afraid to pick on this guy [Obama],” he declares in an interview with the Guardian.</p></blockquote>
<p>Have you ever noticed how many big American stories break in The Guardian, The Daily News, The Telegraph and other British publications? Why is that?</p>
<p>It’s because Seymour Hersh is spot on. The American media is gutless.</p>
<p>I, for one, can not wait to read his book.</p>
<p>I’d highly suggest that you hop on over to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2013/sep/27/seymour-hersh-obama-nsa-american-media" target="_blank">The Guardian Article</a>. You might learn something. I know I did. You also might want to read Professor Chossudovsky’s piece about the <a href="http://dcclothesline.com/2013/09/26/pentagon-orders-purge-of-osama-bin-ladens-death-files-from-data-bank/" target="_blank">Pentagon cover up that is now in play</a>. Do you think they saw Seymour Hersh coming?</p>
<p>Maybe so.</p>
<p>He is still what a journalist is supposed to be. He is feared by the government because he is after the truth.</p>
<p>He may be very somewhat of a throwback in today’s political landscape but we certainly could use more men like Seymour Hersh.

<p style="text-align: left;">What are human workers going to do when super-intelligent robots and computers are better than us at doing <strong>everything</strong>?  That is one of the questions that a <a title="new study" href="http://www.futuretech.ox.ac.uk/sites/futuretech.ox.ac.uk/files/The_Future_of_Employment_OMS_Working_Paper_1.pdf" target="_blank">new study</a> by Dr. Carl Frey and Dr. Michael Osborne of Oxford University sought to address, and what they concluded was that 47 percent of all U.S. jobs could be automated within the next 20 years.  Considering the fact that the percentage of the U.S. population that is employed is already <a title="far lower than it was a decade ago" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-number-of-private-sector-jobs-fell-by-278000-last-month-but-the-economy-is-getting-better" target="_blank">far lower than it was a decade ago</a>, it is frightening to think that tens of millions more jobs could disappear due to technological advances over the next couple of decades.  I have written <a title="extensively" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/category/trade" target="_blank">extensively</a> about how we are already losing millions of jobs to super cheap labor on the other side of the globe.  What are middle class families going to do as technology also takes away huge numbers of our jobs at an ever increasing pace?  We live during a period of history when knowledge is increasing an an exponential rate.  In the past, when human workers were displaced by technology it also created new kinds of jobs that the world had never seen before.  But what happens when the day arrives when computers and robots can do almost everything more cheaply and more efficiently than humans can?</p>
<p>For employers, there are a whole host of advantages that come with replacing human workers with technology.  Robots and computers never complain, they never get tired, they never need vacation, they never show up late, they never waste time on Facebook, they don&#8217;t need any health benefits and there are a vast array of rules, regulations and taxes that you must deal with when you hire a human worker.</p>
<p>If you could get a task done more cheaply and more efficiently by replacing a human worker with technology, why wouldn&#8217;t you want to do it?</p>
<p>We are already starting to see this happen on a mass scale, and according to Dr. Frey and Dr. Osborne, close to half of all of our jobs could be automated within the next 20 years.  A recent article posted on <a title="smartplanet.com" href="http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/bulletin/half-of-all-us-jobs-will-be-automated-but-what-opportunities-will-be-created/29406" target="_blank">smartplanet.com</a> described how this process might play out&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The automation of half the nation’s jobs will occur in two phases, the study says: The first wave will affect (and is affecting) jobs in transportation/logistics, production labor, administrative support, services, sales, and construction. The second wave — propelled by artificial intelligence — will affect jobs in management, science, engineering, and the arts.</p>
<p>Just as interesting as the study is the response provided by Gary Reber, founder and executive director of <a title="For Economic Justice" href="http://www.foreconomicjustice.org" target="_blank">For Economic Justice</a>, who argues that owners of the means of production will actually thrive as such a shift takes place. Those who rely on 9-to-5 standard employment arrangements for subsistence are likely to  suffer the most in the automation wave. As Reber put it: ‘Full employment is not an objective of businesses. Companies strive to keep labor input and other costs at a minimum.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of the reasons why the U.S. economy will never produce enough jobs for everyone ever again.</p>
<p>If technology can outperform humans, it is only rational for companies to replace humans with technology.</p>
<p>And this is even starting to happen in fields that require very high levels of education.</p>
<p>Just look at what is happening in the medical field.  Today, millions of people turn to websites such as <a title="WebMD" href="http://www.webmd.com/" target="_blank">WebMD</a> for their medical needs, but this is only just the beginning.  Check out this excerpt from a recent Bloomberg article entitled &#8220;<a title="Doctor Robot Will See You Shortly" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-26/doctor-robot-will-see-you-shortly.html" target="_blank">Doctor Robot Will See You Shortly</a>&#8220;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson <a title="proposes to replace" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/09/26/jjs-sedasys-puts-challenge-to-anesthesiologists/" target="_blank" rel="external">proposes to replace</a> anesthesiologists during simple procedures such as colonoscopies &#8212; not with nurse practitioners, but with machines. Sedasys, which dispenses propofol and monitors a patient automatically, was recently approved for use in healthy adult patients who have no particular risk of complications. Johnson &amp; Johnson will lease the machines to doctor’s offices for $150 per procedure &#8212; cleverly set well below the $600 to $2,000 that anesthesiologists usually charge.</p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly we will always need doctors.</p>
<p>But many of the tasks that doctors once performed will now be performed by technology.</p>
<p>For example, have you heard about &#8220;<a title="OnStar for the Body" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/x-prize-foundation/exponential-health-techno_b_3991485.html" target="_blank">OnStar for the Body</a>&#8221; yet?  Some of these new &#8220;wearable technologies&#8221; are more than a little bit creepy&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Smart, cheaper and point-of-care sensors, such as those being developed for the <a title="Nokia Sensing XCHALLENGE" href="http://www.nokiasensingxchallenge.org/" target="_blank">Nokia Sensing XCHALLENGE</a>, will further enable the &#8216;Digital Checkup&#8217; from anywhere. The world of &#8216;Quantified Self&#8217; and &#8216;Quantified Health&#8217; will lead to a new generation of wearable technologies partnered with <a title="Artificial Intelligence" href="http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/watson_in_healthcare.shtml" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence</a> that will help decipher and make this information actionable.</p>
<p>And this &#8216;actionability&#8217; is key. We hear the term Big Data used in various contexts; when applied to health information it will likely be the smart integration of massive data sets from the &#8216;Internet of things&#8217; with the small data about your activity, mood, and other information. When properly filtered, this data set can give insights on a macro level &#8211; population health &#8211; and micro &#8211; &#8216;<a title="OnStar for the Body" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BhbMPKcOnY" target="_blank">OnStar for the Body</a>&#8216; with a personalized &#8216;check engine light&#8217; to help identify individual problems before they further develop into expensive, difficult-to-treat or fatal conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>We are also seeing humans being replaced in other fields as well.  For instance, <a title="DARPA" href="http://fcw.com/articles/2013/09/26/6-sci-fi-darpa-projects.aspx" target="_blank">DARPA</a> has developed a robot named &#8220;Atlas&#8221; that it hopes will be used in &#8220;disaster-response scenarios&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>DARPA&#8217;s Virtual Robotics Challenge entered a new phase in July, when Atlas — a 6-foot-2-inch, 330-pound robot developed by Boston Dynamics — was introduced to seven teams tasked with training it for disaster-response scenarios. The end goal? &#8220;Supervised autonomy&#8221; so that Atlas and its successors can step into situations too dangerous for humans.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I don&#8217;t really want &#8220;Terminator&#8221; to show up when my family is in the middle of a disaster, but this is where things are headed.</p>
<p>And as technology increases, a lot of good paying middle class jobs are going to be vulnerable.  In fact, <a title="recent study of employment data" href="http://news.yahoo.com/practically-human-smart-machines-job-052642993--finance.html" target="_blank">one study of employment data</a> that examined statistics from 20 countries found that &#8220;almost all the jobs disappearing are in industries that pay middle-class wages, ranging from $38,000 to $68,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those are exactly the sort of &#8220;breadwinner jobs&#8221; that middle class families <a title="rely upon" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-decline-of-breadwinner-jobs-has-resulted-in-the-longest-bread-lines-in-american-history">rely upon</a>.</p>
<p>And of course working class jobs are being replaced by technology as well.  According to <a title="MIT Technology Review" href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/509296/small-factories-give-baxter-the-robot-a-cautious-once-over/?utm_campaign=newsletters&amp;utm_source=newsletter-weekly-business&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20130118" target="_blank">MIT Technology Review</a>, a $22,000 humanoid robot named Baxter has been developed that can easily be programmed to do jobs that have never been automated before&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Brooks’s company, Rethink Robotics, says the robot will spark a “renaissance” in American manufacturing by helping small companies compete against low-wage offshore labor. Baxter will do that by accelerating a trend of factory efficiency that’s eliminated more jobs in the U.S. than overseas competition has. Of the approximately 5.8 million manufacturing jobs the U.S. lost between 2000 and 2010, according to McKinsey Global Institute, two-thirds were lost because of higher productivity and only 20 percent moved to places like China, Mexico, or Thailand.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is for robots like Baxter to take over more complex tasks, such as fitting together parts on an electronics assembly line. “A couple more ticks of Moore’s Law and you’ve got automation that works more cheaply than Chinese labor does,” Andrew McAfee, an MIT researcher, predicted last year at a conference in Tucson, Arizona, where Baxter was discussed.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what are human workers going to do when robots are making all of our products?</p>
<p>That is a very good question.</p>
<p>Incredibly, robots are now even replacing human factory workers in China.  The following comes from a recent <a title="TechCrunch article" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/foxconn-allegedly-replacing-human-workers-with-robots/?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed" target="_blank">TechCrunch article</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Foxconn <a title="has been planning to buy 1 million robots" href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/01/foxconn-planning-to-hire-1-million-robots/" target="_blank">has been planning to buy 1 million robots</a> to replace human workers and it looks like that change, albeit gradual, is about to start.</p>
<p>The company is allegedly paying $25,000 per robot – about three times a worker’s average salary – and they will replace humans in assembly tasks. The plans have been in place for a while – I spoke to <a title="Foxconn reps about this a year ago" href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/future-of-foxconn/" target="_blank">Foxconn reps about this a year ago</a> – and it makes perfect sense. Humans are messy, they want more money, and having a half-a-million of them in one factory is a recipe for unrest. But what happens after the halls are clear of careful young men and women and instead full of whirring robots?</p></blockquote>
<p>So who benefits from all of this?</p>
<p>Those that own the big corporations that dominate our economy certainly benefit.  They aren&#8217;t going to need to hire as many of us to work for them, and they are going to make even bigger profits than before.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a title="gap between the rich and the poor" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-u-s-has-an-even-larger-gap-between-the-rich-and-the-poor-than-downton-abbey-does">gap between the wealthy and the poor</a> will grow even larger.  The only thing that most people have to offer in the economic marketplace is their labor, and the demand for that labor is decreasing with each passing day.</p>
<p>What do you think will happen to society when most of us are no longer &#8220;needed&#8221;?</p>
<p>Could we be headed for big trouble as a society?</p>
<p>And if you think that your job could &#8220;never be automated&#8221;, you might want to think again.</p>
<p>We are rapidly getting to the point <a title="where even driving will be automated" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323808204579085271065923340.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories" target="_blank">where even driving will be automated</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Brace yourself. In a few years, your car will be able to drop you off at the door of a shopping center or airport terminal, go park itself and return when summoned with a smartphone app. Audi demonstrated such a system at this year&#8217;s Consumer Electronics Show.</p>
<p>At your next dinner party, ask for a show of hands of the people who&#8217;d want that.</p>
<p>Everybody?</p>
<p>Anybody want a car that doesn&#8217;t crash? At this month&#8217;s Frankfurt auto show, mega-auto supplier Continental announced a partnership with <span class="companyRollover link11unvisited">IBM</span> to help bring autonomous vehicles to market, with &#8220;zero accidents&#8221; as a possible result. Volvo has promised to injury-proof its cars by 2020. GM and Carnegie Mellon aim to develop autonomous technology to eliminate car accidents.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what will happen to the <a title="3.1 million Americans" href="http://news.yahoo.com/practically-human-smart-machines-job-052642993--finance.html" target="_blank">3.1 million Americans</a> that drive trucks for a living once all driving is automated?</p>
<p>What will happen to the millions of other Americans that drive buses, taxis and limos once all driving is automated?</p>
<p>That is something to think about.</p>
<p>And researchers are even trying to create computers that <a title="&quot;seem human&quot;" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/economics/2013/09/man-who-wants-total-unemployment-all-human-beings-world" target="_blank">&#8220;seem human&#8221;</a> when you have a conversation with them&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>On 14 September, researchers will <a title="gathered in Derry, Northern Ireland" href="http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html" target="_blank">gathered in Derry, Northern Ireland</a>, to demonstrate their latest efforts. If any of them has created a machine that successfully mimics a human, they will leave $100,000 richer.</p>
<p>The money is being put up by Hugh Loebner, a New York based philanthropist. His goal, he says, is total unemployment for all human beings throughout the world. He wants robots to do all the work. And the first step towards that is apparently to develop computers that seem human when you chat to them.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if your job involves a telephone, you are in danger of being phased out.  In fact, this transition is <a title="talking to a robot" href="http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569573-attractions-employing-robots-rise-software-machines" target="_blank">already starting to happen</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>IPsoft is a young company started by Chetan Dube, a former mathematics professor at New York University. He reckons that artificial intelligence can take over most of the routine information-technology and business-process tasks currently performed by workers in offshore locations. “The last decade was about replacing labour with cheaper labour,” says Mr Dube. “The coming decade will be about replacing cheaper labour with autonomics.”</p>
<p>IPsoft’s Eliza, a “virtual service-desk employee” that learns on the job and can reply to e-mail, answer phone calls and hold conversations, is being tested by several multinationals. At one American media giant she is answering 62,000 calls a month from the firm’s information-technology staff. She is able to solve two out of three of the problems without human help. At IPsoft’s media-industry customer Eliza has replaced India’s Tata Consulting Services.</p></blockquote>
<p>We truly are entering an unprecedented time in human history.</p>
<p>Instead of robots violently taking over society like so many movies have portrayed, they are slowly starting to &#8220;replace&#8221; us instead.  A recent <a title="Wired article" href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/12/ff-robots-will-take-our-jobs/all/" target="_blank">Wired article</a> described what this transition might look like as it picks up steam&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>First, machines will consolidate their gains in already-automated industries. After robots finish replacing assembly line workers, they will replace the workers in warehouses. Speedy bots able to lift 150 pounds all day long will retrieve boxes, sort them, and load them onto trucks. Fruit and vegetable picking will continue to be robotized until no humans pick outside of specialty farms. Pharmacies will feature a single pill-dispensing robot in the back while the pharmacists focus on patient consulting. Next, the more dexterous chores of cleaning in offices and schools will be taken over by late-night robots, starting with easy-to-do floors and windows and eventually getting to toilets. The highway legs of long-haul trucking routes will be driven by robots embedded in truck cabs.</p>
<p>All the while, robots will continue their migration into white-collar work. We already have artificial intelligence in many of our machines; we just don’t call it that. Witness one piece of software by Narrative Science (profiled in issue 20.05) that can write newspaper stories about sports games directly from the games’ stats or generate a synopsis of a company’s stock performance each day from bits of text around the web. Any job dealing with reams of paperwork will be taken over by bots, including much of medicine. Even those areas of medicine not defined by paperwork, such as surgery, are becoming increasingly robotic. The rote tasks of any information-intensive job can be automated. It doesn’t matter if you are a doctor, lawyer, architect, reporter, or even programmer: The robot takeover will be epic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are you ready for the &#8220;robot takeover&#8221;?</p>
<p>The world of employment is never going to be the same again.  Technology has already surpassed human workers in a whole host of arenas, and this transition is only going to become more rapid in the years ahead.

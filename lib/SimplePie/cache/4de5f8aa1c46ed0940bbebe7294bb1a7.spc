<p>A military veteran in Crawford County, Michigan has been arrested and charged with a felony assault with a deadly weapon after <em>he</em> called the cops when he found a man trespassing on his property.</p>
<p>The Blaze has reported that Thomas Donald was out hunting with his son on his own land when they came across the trespasser. Donald had an unloaded .410 shotgun while his son was using a crossbow.</p>
<p>When they came across the trespasser on a dirt bike, they escorted him back to the house and called the Department of Natural Resources. When the police showed up, everything went downhill fast. According to Heather Donald, when the cops showed up, Thomas Donald held up his open shotgun in one hand and held a shell in his other hand to show that he was not a threat.</p>
<p>But, the police did not get the hint and they soon had a pistol pointed at Donald as they put him in handcuffs and onto the ground. The following video shows what Heather was able to record before the police forced her to turn off the cell phone camera.</p>

<p>Mitsubishi thinks the US car market is ready for a return automotive minimalism &#8211; perhaps because so many people have minimal money to spend these days &#8211; and so will embrace a car like the 2014 Metro &#8230; er, <em>Mirage</em>.</p>
<p>Not since the little Geo (last sold new in &#8217;97) has any major automaker sold a four door sedan with fewer than four cylinders  &#8211; and less than 80 hp &#8211; under the hood.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/97-metro-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-24360"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24360" alt="'97 Metro picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/97-Metro-picture-300x188.jpg" width="300" height="188" /></a></p>
<p>The Mirage also registers exactly the same 37 city, 44 highway that the &#8217;97 Metro touted. Sure, it&#8217;s <em>slow</em> &#8211; but nothing that&#8217;s not a hybrid or a diesel (or a motorcycle) can touch this thing&#8217;s <em>economy</em> right now.</p>
<p>And with a starting price just under $13k, the new Mirage is also just about the least expensive new sedan you can buy. Only the stripped down version of Nissan&#8217;s Versa has a lower sticker price &#8211; $11,990 &#8211; but the Mirage is nearly 10 MPG more fuel-efficient than the base model Versa.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s no such thing as a free lunch &#8211; and that applies to the new Mirage as much as anything else.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get into <em>that</em> now.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IT IS<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/2014-mirages-all-colors/" rel="attachment wp-att-24368"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24368" alt="2014 Mirages all colors" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2014-Mirages-all-colors-300x184.jpg" width="300" height="184" /></a></strong></p>
<p>The Mirage is an entry-level subcompact five-door hatchback with a price tag of $12,995 to start &#8211; $14,195 &#8220;loaded.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is the first three-cylinder-powered sedan to be sold in the United States since the 1990s-era Geo.</p>
<p>Because of its lowball price &#8211; and exceptional high fuel economy- the Mirage has no direct competition.</p>
<p>Ford will offer a three-cylinder engine in the 2014 Fiesta in early calendar year 2014 &#8211; but it will be <em>turbocharged</em> as well as <em>optional</em>. A base trim four-cylinder Fiesta sedan starts at $14,400 &#8211; so even if the pending three-cylinder &#8220;Ecoboost&#8221; engine is a no-cost option, the Ford still starts out $1,405 higher. Probably, the three-cylinder engine will add at least another couple hundred bucks to the car&#8217;s MSRP.</p>
<p>The other three-cylinder car on the market is the SmartCar &#8211; but it&#8217;s a both two-door car and a two-<em>seater</em> car.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT&#8217;S NEW<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/old-mirage-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-24359"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24359" alt="old Mirage picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/old-Mirage-picture-300x180.jpg" width="300" height="180" /></a></strong></p>
<p>The Mirage <em>name</em> isn&#8217;t but the <em>model</em> is. It&#8217;s the first all-new Mitsubishi product in several years &#8211; and the future viability of Mitsubishi as an automaker may depend on its success&#8230; or its failure.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi has been struggling ever since the disastrous &#8220;0 down, 0 interest, 0 payments for a year&#8221; marketing plan it tried back in the late &#8217;90s. The plan attracted &#8220;buyers&#8221; who wanted a car but either <em>couldn&#8217;t</em> pay for one or had no <em>intention</em> of ever paying for it &#8211; but were happy to take Mitsu up on its offer to let them drive around in a brand-new car for <em>free</em> for a year. Lots of Evos went up in smoke this way &#8211; as did Mitsu&#8217;s cash reserves.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/2014-mirage-trunk-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-24361"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24361" alt="2014 Mirage trunk picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2014-Mirage-trunk-picture-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why there haven&#8217;t been many new Mitsus lately &#8211; or even major updates of <em>existing</em> Mitsus.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT&#8217;S GOOD</strong></p>
<p>Under $13k sticker &#8211; and Mitsubishi&#8217;s as desperate as a 45-year-old cougar. Probably, you could buy one  &#8211; the car, not the cougar &#8211; for closer to $11k.</p>
<p>Exceptionally high fuel economy &#8211; 44 highway and 37 city. This is better than the <em>diesel</em> VW Beetle I reviewed last week, which only managed 28 city, 41 highway.</p>
<p>AC is standard; Bluetooth is available.</p>
<p>Sensible shoes 14 inch <em>steel</em> wheels.</p>
<p>You can get an automatic &#8211; and it&#8217;s a fully <em>modern</em> automatic.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT&#8217;S NOT SO GOOD</strong></p>
<p>Metro slow &#8211; about 13 seconds to 60 with the optional CVT automatic.</p>
<p>Iffy status of Mitsubishi.</p>
<p>Iffy quality control history of Mitsubishi.</p>
<p><strong>UNDER THE HOOD<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/2014-mirage-engine/" rel="attachment wp-att-24351"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24351" alt="2014 Mirage engine" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2014-Mirage-engine-300x187.jpg" width="300" height="187" /></a></strong></p>
<p>The Mirage&#8217;s powerplant is a Metro-esque 1.2 liter three-cylinder engine that makes 74 horsepower. It is actually slightly larger &#8211; and slightly stronger-  than the &#8217;97 Metro&#8217;s 1.0 liter, 55 hp three.</p>
<p>Fuel efficiency, though is identical: 37 city, 44 highway.</p>
<p>There is not another car <em></em>out there that can touch this. Not unless it&#8217;s a hybrid (or diesel-powered) car.</p>
<p>Some comparos:</p>
<p>The Fiat 500 three-door hatchback is one of the most gas-sippy new cars available, but only rates 31 city, 41 highway.  The larger Fiat 500L has four doors &#8211; but  registers just 25 city, 33 highway. Perhaps because it weighs <em>1,340 lbs.</em> more.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/2014-mirage-engine-start-button/" rel="attachment wp-att-24364"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24364" alt="2014 Mirage engine start button" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2014-Mirage-engine-start-button-300x183.jpg" width="300" height="183" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, you read that right. A 500L weighs 3,203 lbs. &#8211; a pretty rotten automotive body mass index for a relatively small car.</p>
<p>The Mirage&#8217;s curb weight, meanwhile, is a small car-appropriate 1,863 lbs.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, this is almost dead-ringer for the &#8217;97 Metro&#8217;s 1,832 lbs.</p>
<p>Back to the comparisons&#8230; .</p>
<p>The Nissan Versa S offers 31 city, 40 highway &#8211; <em>if</em> you buy the extra cost CVT automatic. The base ($11,900) Versa gets 27 city, 36 highway.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not even in the same ballpark as the Mirage.</p>
<p>Even the three-cylinder Smartcar coughs up no more than 34 city and 38 highway &#8211; and it&#8217;s a car you probably wouldn&#8217;t want to take out on the highway.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/2014-mirage-cvt/" rel="attachment wp-att-24365"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24365" alt="2014 Mirage CVT" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2014-Mirage-CVT-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>The pending (spring 2014) three-cylinder Ford Fiesta will &#8211; reportedly &#8211; exceed 40 MPG on the highway. But in addition to costing significantly more than the Mitsu, the three-cylinder version of the Fiesta will reportedly only be sold with a manual transmission.</p>
<p>This is probably appropriate given the smallness of the engine  &#8211; and the slowness of performance. When a small engine is teamed up with an automatic, the results are typically not so hot (more on this in a moment). Still, the fact remains that most buyers (about eight out of ten) prefer an automatic. If that describes you, cross the Ford off your list.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi has also given the Mirage a <em>modern</em> automatic.</p>
<p>The optional continuously variable (CVT) is technologically current. The Nissan&#8217;s Versa&#8217;s step-up <em>four-speed</em> automatic isn&#8217;t. (Nissan also offers a CVT in the Versa &#8211; but to get this transmission &#8211; and decent fuel economy &#8211; you have to step up to the Plus trim, which starts at $13,790 vs. $11,990 for the base 1.6 S trim.)<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/2014-mirage-dash-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-24350"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24350" alt="2014 Mirage dash picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2014-Mirage-dash-picture-300x187.jpg" width="300" height="187" /></a> Otherwise, it&#8217;s 26 city, 35 highway &#8211; which is borderline lousy for a 2014 model year compact-sized car.</p>
<p>Ok. Ready for the <em>bad</em> news?</p>
<p>If you opt for the automatic, your Mirage will take a <em>long</em> time to get going. Zero to 60 happens in about 13 seconds, under ideal conditions. To get handle on just how leisurely that is, consider: The slowest Prius &#8211; the Prius C &#8211; is about a second quicker to 60. A four-cylinder Fiesta gets to 60 in less than 10 seconds. The turbo&#8217;d three-cylinder Fiesta might even be <em>quicker</em> than that &#8211; given it has 123 hp (49 more than the Mirage).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you can handle shifting for yourself, the manual-equipped Mirage is capable of getting you to 60 in about 11.6 seconds &#8211; still slower than manual-equipped small cars like the Fiat 500 (10.5 seconds) but within striking distance of a Prius C.</p>
<p><strong>ON THE ROAD<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/2014-mirage-road-test-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-24354"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24354" alt="2014 Mirage road test picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2014-Mirage-road-test-picture--300x187.jpg" width="300" height="187" /></a></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, the Mirage is slow.</p>
<p>But is it <em>too</em> slow?</p>
<p>The answer depends on your frame of reference &#8211; and what you&#8217;re comfortable living with.</p>
<p>For instance, compared to a &#8217;97 Geo Metro, the new Mirage is downright <em>speedy</em>. The Metro took almost 14 seconds to hit 60. Yet people drove it in traffic &#8211; and on the highways. If it was doable then, it&#8217;s certainly doable today. It just takes a driver willing &#8211; and able &#8211; to work with what the car&#8217;s got. A driver who knows the tricks of maintaining momentum, of <em>anticipating</em> the ebb and flow of traffic. If the light up ahead is red, he will try to pace himself so that by the time he reaches it, it&#8217;s gone green again &#8211; so he doesn&#8217;t have to <em>stop</em>. If he&#8217;s already rolling, he&#8217;s got a big advantage over even a speedy car that <em>is</em> stopped<em></em>.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/2014-mirage-speedo/" rel="attachment wp-att-24356"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24356" alt="2014 Mirage speedo" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2014-Mirage-speedo-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve owned several <em>really</em> slow cars &#8211; cars that made even a <em>Metro</em> seem like a tri-power 427 Corvette. One of them was a &#8217;73 Beetle I drove in DC rush hour traffic every day for several years. Which can actually be fun -<em> if</em> you <em>like</em> to drive &#8211; and <em>if</em> know <em>how</em> to drive. There is a saying that contains a lot of truth:</p>
<p><em>It is more fun to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slow.</em></p>
<p>Absolutely. When I lived up in the DC area, one of the most frustrating things I had to deal with was getting something like a new M5 or Viper to test drive &#8211; and find myself jockeying for position in the bump-and-grind with cars like my &#8217;73 Beetle &#8211; and Geo Metros. <em>I</em> wasn&#8217;t getting there any faster than <em>them</em> &#8211; and <em>they</em> weren&#8217;t getting 15 MPG.</p>
<p>Consider: <a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/2014-mitsubishi-mirage-es/" rel="attachment wp-att-24362"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24362" alt="2014 Mitsubishi Mirage ES" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2014-Mirage-road-test-two-300x183.jpg" width="300" height="183" /></a></p>
<p>Is it not smarter to save the M5, the Viper, the Corvette &#8211; the <em>fun</em> car, whatever it happens to be &#8211; for when you can <em>have</em> fun with it?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can amuse yourself well enough in a car like this Mirage &#8211; when it is driven in its element, which is stop-and-go traffic. True, it&#8217;s a bit out of its depth on the highway &#8211; but then, so was the Metro (and so was my old Beetle). Doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t take it out on the highway. You absolutely could.</p>
<p>You just have to know its limits &#8211; and yours.</p>
<p><strong>AT THE CURB<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/2014-mirage/" rel="attachment wp-att-24363"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24363" alt="2014 Mirage" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2014-Mirage-side-view-2-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a></strong></p>
<p>The footprint of the &#8217;14 Mirage is actually smaller by nearly a foot overall than that of the &#8217;97 Metro sedan: 148.8 inches vs. 164 inches. But &#8211; as is the trend in new car design &#8211; the Mirage sits much taller: 59.1 inches vs. 55.4 for the Metro. It is also several inches wider: 65.6 inches vs. 62.6 for the &#8217;97 Geo.</p>
<p>What you end up with is a stubby &#8211; but tall/wide &#8211; car that fits into tight spaces <em>outside</em> but which isn&#8217;t too tight-fitting on the <em>inside</em>. The Mirage has 41.7 inches of legroom up front, and 39.1 inches of headroom and 51.7 inches of shoulder room. This is decent &#8211; very decent, actually &#8211; for a subcompact.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/2014-mirage-front-seat-room/" rel="attachment wp-att-24352"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24352" alt="2014 Mirage front seat room" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2014-Mirage-front-seat-room-300x187.jpg" width="300" height="187" /></a></p>
<p>Again, some comparos:</p>
<p>The much smaller(and two-door) Fiat 500 coupe has 40.7 inches of front row legroom, 38.9 inches of headroom and 49.4 inches of front row shoulder room. Its backseat has just 31.7 inches of space.</p>
<p>The <em>four-door</em> Mitsu offers 34 inches &#8211; exceptional, for a car in this size bracket.</p>
<p>The four-door 500L &#8211; which is a <em>larger</em> than the Mirage -  only has 40.7 inches of front row legroom &#8211; and a preposterous 30.7 inches of second row legroom. That&#8217;s less than the <em>two-door</em> 500 &#8211; and three-plus inches less than the Mirage sedan has.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/2014-mirage-back-seat/" rel="attachment wp-att-24353"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24353" alt="2014 Mirage back seat" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2014-Mirage-back-seat-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a tight squeeze in the Ford Fiesta &#8211; which has about an inch less shoulder room in both rows (50.6 and 49 inches, respectively, vs. 51.7 and 51.0 for the Mitsu) and just 31.2 inches of second row legroom (the Ford has slightly more legroom up front, 42.2 inches).</p>
<p>Nissan&#8217;s Versa gives you more interior space in both rows &#8211; including 37 inches of backseat legroom &#8211; which is more than many mid-sized sedans have. But as mentioned earlier, the Versa&#8217;s not nearly as fuel-efficient as the Mirage &#8211; even when ordered with its extra-cost CVT transmission.</p>
<p><strong>THE REST<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/2014-mirage-gps/" rel="attachment wp-att-24357"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24357" alt="2014 Mirage GPS" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2014-Mirage-GPS-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></strong></p>
<p>On the numbers, this looks like a winner. The sedan layout is inherently practical; 37 MPG in <em>city</em> driving is better than several cars in the compact class manage on the <em>highway</em>. The base trim car &#8211; the one that&#8217;s not quite $13k at full MSRP &#8211; includes <em>automatic climate control</em> air conditioning (a step up from manual AC), <em>seven</em> air bags (five years ago, that would have been more air bags than you&#8217;d have gotten in an S-Class Mercedes), keyless entry and a decent stereo with iPod hook-up. Plus power windows and door locks.</p>
<p>Really, what else does one <em>need</em>? <a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/2014-mirage-wheel-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-24355"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24355" alt="2014 Mirage wheel picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2014-Mirage-wheel-picture-300x187.jpg" width="300" height="187" /></a></p>
<p>And the car doesn&#8217;t come with things you <em>don&#8217;t</em> really need &#8211; like 17 inch (or even 16 inch) alloy wheels (fragile) and the expensive tires that come with those &#8220;rims.&#8221; Instead, as is proper for an A to B transportation appliance, the Mirage comes standard with 14-inch steel wheels and tires that cost $70 a piece to replace instead of $150 a piece. The fourteen inchers have other advantages, too &#8211; including less rolling resistance (helps fuel economy) and they&#8217;re easier to handle (as when you have to deal with a flat) being smaller and thus, lighter.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi offers alloy wheels, LED interior lighting, parking assist and navigation &#8211; even leather trim &#8211; but to me, adding such stuff to a car like this is like tipping the drive-thru kid at McDonald&#8217;s $20 on top of the the $8.00 bag of burgers he just handed you.</p>
<p>This car makes sense if you stick with the program. If you want something <em>more</em> than an inexpensive, functionally unobjectionable way to get around &#8211; there are better choices. But if you mean to keep your costs down to the absolute minimum without torturing yourself, this one&#8217;s an <em>excellent</em> choice.</p>
<p>Especially if you strong-arm the poor bastard trying to sell you one. Pity Mitsu salesmen &#8211; and dealers. <em>They</em> know <em>you</em> know how <em>desperate</em> they are.</p>
<p>Make the most of it. <a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/29/2014-mitsubishi-mirage/2014-mirage-rear-side-view/" rel="attachment wp-att-24358"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24358" alt="2014 Mirage rear side view" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2014-Mirage-rear-side-view-300x187.jpg" width="300" height="187" /></a></p>
<p><strong>THE BOTTOM LINE</strong></p>
<p>If you missed out on the Metro back in the &#8217;90s, now&#8217;s your chance to relive history &#8211; the good and the bad.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame that America needs a car like this &#8211; but the fact is a 44 MPG A to B unit that you can probably take home for $12k or so is exactly the right car for these very wrong times.</p>
<p><em>Throw it in the Woods?</em></p>

<p align="left">Former Governor Jesse Ventura and radio personality Howard Stern are set for a sensational 2016 presidential run.</p>
<p align="left">Ventura will fly to New York this Wednesday to appear on Stern’s Sirius XM show, during which <a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/stern.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-24344" alt="stern" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/stern-300x183.jpg" width="300" height="183" /></a>Ventura will formally request that Stern join him on the ticket.</p>
<p align="left">Ventura told the Alex Jones Show that he is deadly serious about running for the White House with Stern as his VP. Due to Ventura’s refusal to entertain the notion of taking money from special interests, Stern, whose radio show brings in around $100 million a year, will be in charge of fundraising.</p>
<p align="left">Although Ventura had to quit his radio show when he ran for Governor of Minnesota in order to comply with FCC regulations, Stern will not have to quit his current show because satellite radio is not subject to the same rules as terrestrial radio.</p>
<p align="left">However, <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sirius-xm-ceo-committed-keeping-637323">Stern has indicated</a> he will probably quit his current show in 2015 anyway, leaving the path clear for a presidential campaign to begin the same year.</p>
<p align="left">Off air, Ventura told Jones that Stern is one of the smartest people he knows and that his libertarian mindset make the two a perfect combination. It is likely that Ventura and Stern will attempt to secure the Libertarian Party nomination, which in 2012 was won by former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson.</p>
<p align="left">Stern previously ran for Governor of New York as a libertarian candidate in 1994, promising to fix the roads and repeal the death penalty.</p>
<p align="left">Ventura is about to commence a book tour but confirmed that he would run for president, with Stern as his VP, exclusively with the Alex Jones Show.</p>

<p>Which prompted this question from one of the regulars here:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dom, how much does it cost to have one of those monitoring services do the grunt work to protect the site from attacks?&#8221;</p>
<p>We are looking into this.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that there ain&#8217;t no such thing as a free lunch. It will no doubt cost us something &#8211; we hope not too much &#8211; to have automatic/full-time monitoring. We&#8217;re also going to be doing back-ups of the entire site much more often &#8211; as a &#8220;just in case.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re trying to balance everything, post-Google.</p>
<p>So far, we have acquired one new advertiser &#8211; the precious metal dealer on the top right of the main page. We&#8217;d very much like to get some additional advertisers &#8211; so if you know anyone at a business that might be interested, please let them know and have them get in touch with us.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we&#8217;re still dependent on reader support. Please pass the word on that, too.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the aspect of this foul business I wanted to rant about is the suggestion &#8211; repeatedly made &#8211; that Obamacare will save young workers <em>so</em> much money.</p>
<p>I was a young worker once. Want to know how I saved money?</p>
<p><em>By not signing up for health insurance</em> &#8211; which is something most 24-year-olds need about as much as most 80-year-olds need a skateboard.</p>
<p>Sure, you <em>might</em> break a leg. It&#8217;s <em>possible</em>, I suppose, that a 24-year-old could develop a serious illness such as cancer. Possible &#8211; but not very.</p>
<p>Hardly, more like it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s <em>sensible</em>, therefore &#8211; and neither irresponsible nor (as the collectivists style it) &#8220;selfish&#8221; &#8211; to skip insurance in one&#8217;s young 20s &#8211; and instead save the money and put it toward the things that will make later life more financially secure &#8211; which will then allow you to deal with medical problems far better than you&#8217;d be able to if you haven&#8217;t built wealth by then.</p>
<p>How, exactly, is a young man or woman supposed to save up the 10 percent cash payment most lenders demand in order to qualify for a home loan when one is handing over $300 a month to the insurance Mafia? Even if it&#8217;s only $200 a month, it adds up real quick. $2,400 a year &#8211; for say five years, from 24 to 29 &#8211; and (poof!) there went $12,000. How many recent college grads, just starting out in their chosen profession, can afford to toss $12k?</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>So, I did an inventory. I was young. I was healthy. I neither smoked nor drank (<em>much</em>). It seemed to me to be a low risk, high-yield thing to skip the insurance. To accept the slight possibility that I might have to deal with a major medical issue vs. the absolute certainty of throwing $12k out the window.</p>
<p>Instead, I put that money toward my first house. Which put me in the position to be able to buy my next house. Which enabled me to build wealth rather than give it away.</p>
<p>These notions &#8211; risk taking, cost-benefit analysis and most of all, <em>free choice</em>, are anathema under Obamacare. The government will decide for you which risks are too risky; will take away your freedom to choose. Today&#8217;s 24-year-olds will find it much harder to build wealth because their wealth will be taken from them &#8211; along with their liberty.</p>
<p>The smart ones know this already. The dumb ones &#8211; the ones who believe there <em>is</em> such a thing as a free lunch &#8211; and the collectivized ones, who want to make other people pay for theirs &#8211; are about to learn a rude lesson.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not 24 anymore.</p>

<strong> Seymour Hersh: Bin Laden Raid “One Big Lie”</strong></p>
<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh says that the raid which killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011 is “one big lie” and that “not one word” of the Obama administration’s narrative on what happened is true.<br />
Seymour Hersh: Bin Laden Raid One Big Lie 270913bin</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging interview published today by the Guardian, Hersh savages the US media for failing to challenge the White House on a whole host of issues, from NSA spying, to drone attacks, to aggression against Syria.</p>
<p>On the subject of the Navy Seal raid that supposedly resulted in the death of the Al-Qaeda terror leader, Hersh remarked, “Nothing’s been done about that story, it’s one big lie, not one word of it is true.”</p>
<p>Hersh added that the Obama administration habitually lies but they continue to do so because the press allows them to get away with it.</p>
<p>“It’s pathetic, they are more than obsequious, they are afraid to pick on this guy [Obama],” Hersh told the Guardian.</p>
<p>The raid that supposedly led to Bin Laden’s death has been shrouded in mystery for over two years. Speculation that the Obama administration may have embellished or outright lied about the true account of what happened has persisted, mainly because the White House has refused to publicly release images of Bin Laden’s body.</p>
<p>Although the White House said the corpse was immediately “buried at sea” in line with Islamic tradition, it quickly emerged that this was not standard practice.</p>
<p>Numerous analysts have claimed that Bin Laden had in fact been dead for years and that the raid on his alleged compound in Pakistan was little more than a stunt.</p>
<p>Other questions also persist, such as why the narrative and timeline of the raid has changed multiple times, why the White House initially claimed that “situation room” photos showed Obama watching the raid live when in fact there was a blackout on the live feed, and whyneighbors in the immediate area surrounding the compound said with absolute certainty that they had never seen Bin Laden and that they knew of no evidence whatsoever to suggest he lived there.</p>
<p>During the rest of the Guardian interview, which is well worth reading in its entirety, Hersh lambastes the corporate press and particularly the New York Times, which he says spends “so much more time carrying water for Obama than I ever thought they would.”</p>
<p>Hersh’s solution is to shut down news networks like NBC and ABC and fire 90% of mainstream editors, replacing them with real journalists who are outsiders and not afraid to speak truth to power.</p>
<p>“The republic’s in trouble, we lie about everything, lying has become the staple,” concluded Hersh.</p>

<p>This should be obvious by now &#8211; to anyone who has watched the pathetic spectacle of disarmed (and thus, helpless) men and women being cattle-chuted out of a building with their hands over their heads in the &#8220;I surrender&#8221; pose following a mass shooting &#8211; almost invariably perpetrated in a &#8220;gun free&#8221; zone.</p>
<p>Or by the way Obamacare will decide <em>for</em> you whether you need to buy health insurance &#8211; what <em>kind</em> of health insurance &#8211; and how <em>much</em> you&#8217;ll pay for it. The way your doctor will become another government agent, making decisions for you, <em>controlling</em> you &#8211; and your family&#8217;s private affairs &#8211; at the behest of the government.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/26/emasculization/fearful-turtle/" rel="attachment wp-att-24276"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24276" alt="Fearful turtle" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Fearful-turtle-300x230.jpg" width="300" height="230" /></a></p>
<p>The way the government dictates the type of car you&#8217;re <em>allowed</em> to buy &#8211; or build (if you wanted to).</p>
<p>The way they tell you what you may &#8211; and may not &#8211; do with your own physical body.</p>
<p>They way they affront your personal space &#8211; including your <em>family&#8217;s</em> personal space &#8211; at every turn.</p>
<p>It is relentless, systematic, synergistic &#8211; and absolutely deliberate. Part of a comprehensive plan that&#8217;s been carefully constructed and nurtured and advanced over decades to emasculate the populace so as to render it not only amenable to being led and controlled, but begging to be led and controlled.</p>
<p>Example: Successfully attack the principle that a man (or a woman) has the <em>right</em> to defend himself by taking away the means of self-defense and you&#8217;ve made him helpless, which makes him fearful &#8230; which renders him <em>dependent</em>.</p>
<p>Including that person&#8217;s <em>family</em> &#8211; because <em>they</em> cannot depend on <em>him</em>. And so they look to government &#8211; their &#8220;leaders&#8221; &#8211; for succor. To be kept &#8220;safe.&#8221;  Please, <em>help</em> us!  <em>Do</em> something!</p>
<p>Never &#8211; what can<em> I</em> do? <em>I&#8217;ll</em> handle it.</p>
<p>This is<em> exactly</em> what those who seek to control and lead are after.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/26/emasculization/cringer-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-24278"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24278" alt="Cringer picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Cringer-picture-300x219.jpg" width="300" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>A man with a gun in his home stands a good chance of successfully defending his home &#8211; his kids, his wife &#8211; against a violent intruder. The mere fact that a homeowner might have a gun is by itself a very strong deterrent &#8211; ask any thug.</p>
<p>This is hugely empowering. And it is why the right to keep and bear arms is under such concerted and vicious attack. Strip a man of the ability to defend himself and his family and you emasculate him. You diminish him as a man in his own eyes and in the eyes of his family. You make him something less than a man. Because after all, what else can you call a person unable to defend himself, his wife and kids? Who must <em>cringe</em> in a locked bathroom with them while he desperately calls on <em>other men</em> to come and save him. Such a man is something less than a man.</p>
<p>Again, exactly what&#8217;s wanted.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/26/emasculization/woman-with-gun-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-24277"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-24277" alt="woman with gun picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/woman-with-gun-picture.png" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>And of course, the same is true for women &#8211; perhaps even more so, because the object here is also to cause her to despise her man. Men, in general &#8211; except those designated as enforcers for the state. <em>These</em>, she is taught to reverence as &#8220;heroes.&#8221;</p>
<p>But never her own husband or boyfriend.</p>
<p>A woman who carries a gun knows she stands a chance against a man intent upon assaulting her. That she can do more than <em>scream</em>. That she is safe in her home &#8211; or walking to her car. That she is not utterly at the mercy of others, at any rate &#8211; <em>because she can fight back</em>. This imparts self-respect, confidence &#8211; and most alarming of all (to those intent upon leading and controlling) it renders <em>them</em> irrelevant. They&#8217;re not <em>needed</em> &#8211; literally &#8211; and thus, <em>psychologically</em>.</p>
<p>What, above all else, defines an adult human being? Is it not the ability to take care of oneself? Physically as well as financially? To be in <em>control</em>. To decide for oneself. To not have to always defer to <em>others</em>.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/26/emasculization/man-in-diapers-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-24279"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24279" alt="man in diapers picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/man-in-diapers-picture-300x237.jpg" width="300" height="237" /></a></p>
<p>If <em>that</em> is taken away, what have you got?</p>
<p>A biological adult with the mental state of a <em>child</em>. A creature aware that childhood is long gone but for whom the status of <em>grownup</em> never arrived. The nagging feeling of insecurity, of being out of control.</p>
<p>And <em>under</em> the control of others.</p>
<p>It engenders self-loathing and &#8211; above all &#8211; a loathing for those who still have their self-respect. Who have <em>not</em> knuckled under; who say, <em>Piss off!</em> Who resist. Who refuse to comply and Do As Ordered. Observe the sneering contempt &#8211; the spittle-spewing fury &#8211; directed at those who insist upon their right to possess guns, or who denounce &#8220;safety&#8221; checkpoints, Obamacare and all the rest of it. It is more than merely disagreement. It is the keening wail of a child infuriated at the sight of another child (as he sees them) being <em>allowed</em> to <em>get away with it</em>.</p>
<p>The same thread runs through virtually everything the government &#8211; that is, those who insist they have the <em>right</em> to dictate the terms and conditions of our lives &#8211; does to us.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/26/emasculization/crybaby-pictures/" rel="attachment wp-att-24295"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24295" alt="crybaby pictures" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/crybaby-pictures-297x300.jpg" width="297" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Gun control,&#8221; Obamacare, seat belt laws, the TSA folderol &#8211; all touted as being  about &#8220;protecting&#8221; us and necessary to &#8220;keep us safe&#8221; &#8211; exactly the sort of things a parent tells a child. In fact they are all about <em>demeaning</em> grown human beings by empowering other human beings to treat them like idiot children &#8211; most especially in full view of their own families. To scold and threaten them &#8211; as at &#8220;seatbelt checkpoints.&#8221; Is it conceivable, really, to break down the self-respect of a grown man more completely than by having an authority figure &#8211; often one his junior in age as well as intelligence &#8211; order him to &#8220;buckle up&#8221;? <em>In front of his wife and kids</em>? It is not even necessary to do so at a checkpoint. A child learns that his father &#8211; this supposed man he sprang from &#8211; must  obey <em>his</em> parents (the government, its enforcers) just as <em>he</em> must obey <em>his</em>. It&#8217;s an embarrassment, a shaming.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/26/emasculization/seatbelt-check-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-24280"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24280" alt="seatbelt check picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/seatbelt-check-picture-300x135.jpg" width="300" height="135" /></a></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s <em>exactly</em> the point. The <em>object</em>, rather.</p>
<p>Just like it&#8217;s the point of Obamacare, which will not only force you to buy something you may very reasonably and rationally think you&#8217;ve got no real need for but which will also become the means by which government &#8211; those with guns and funny costumes who believe they have the right to dictate how we live our lives &#8211; will interject themselves into the few remaining slivers of freedom-of-action we&#8217;ve still got left. <em>Nothing</em> will be your own to decide anymore. Not how you live your life, not how you raise your kids. Not what you eat, nor how you recreate. The very concept of <em>yours</em> will be abolished. <em>Nothing</em> will be left up to <em>you</em>.  <a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/26/emasculization/obamacare-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-24281"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24281" alt="Obamacare picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Obamacare-picture-300x227.jpg" width="300" height="227" /></a></p>
<p>Adult parenting will become all-encompassing.</p>
<p>Just as onerous taxes &#8211; especially the inescapable ones on homes and land and other forms of property -  are designed specifically to prevent anyone from ever achieving any semblance of true independence via self-sufficiency at least as much they are to generate revenue for the state. The whole object is to reduce the population to a state of perpetual, low-grade gnawing fear and dependence. To keep them working &#8211; and paying and never, above all else, given time for <em>thinking</em>.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/09/26/emasculization/resist-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-24297"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-24297" alt="resist picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/resist-picture-290x300.gif" width="290" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Deny them their self-respect. Their adulthood. Humble them, most particularly the men. Encourage women &#8211; and the kids &#8211; to look to specially chosen men (the state and its enforcers) for their &#8220;safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest will naturally follow.</p>
<p><em>If</em> we allow it.</p>
<p>The good news is a small but growing number of Americans have decided they <em>won&#8217;t</em> allow it. That they have had enough. That they will resist. Intellectually, by rejecting the idea that <em>anyone</em> has the right to dictate to anyone else how they will live their lives. Physically, if need be &#8211; If they refuse to leave us be and continue to force themselves upon us.</p>

Music told policestateusa.com that it was a Nissan Xterra from Virginia Beach, VA. As Music wrote in a blog post, “I will not have that influence around my family,” saying she was trying to do the right thing by making a report. The acquaintance was still on the property and Music had not let on that she had gone to talk to the police.</p>
<p>Music wrote on that while she was providing officers with details of the stolen property, and the individual who had brought it over, she also explicitly told the police not to shoot her dogs.</p>
<p>“The puppy may jump, we have been trying to get her out of that,” Music explained, stating that the dogs were friendly puppies. She said the officers laughed and told her not to worry about it. Unconvinced, she emphasized again: “PLEASE don’t shoot my dogs, they are my babies.”</p>
<p>The officers asked her to stay at the station while units were sent to her home to obtain the property and arrest the individual who may have stolen it. Her dogs, Ammo and Half-Pint, and roommate, Kyle Sewall, age 22, waited at home. Sewall gave his account in an exclusive interview with policestateusa.com.</p>
<p>“I was waiting on officers to arrive, Ammo needed to go the bathroom and she had been whimpering for 15 minutes. So I gave in and let her out,” said Sewall. “The person who had stolen the property was outside cleaning the stolen vehicle with a shop-vac and while I kept an eye on Ammo I was talking to him playing it cool.” He continued:</p>
<p><strong>“About 5 minutes later is when the sheriffs pulled up, came flying in. Sgt Little was exiting the vehicle and as he was exiting I noticed he already had his sidearm trained on Ammo who was just sniffing around the ground wagging her tail. And then she looked up at him, did not growl, did not bark, and before I could say anything he fired his weapon. Shot her point blank in the head,”Sewall told policestateusa.com.</strong></p>
<p>“I went to go rush toward Ammo and he trained his weapon on me,” Sewall explained. “I identified myself saying, ‘I am Kyle, lower your weapon.’ He did and they allowed me to tend to Ammo.</p>

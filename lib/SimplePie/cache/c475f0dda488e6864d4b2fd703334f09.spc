  <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-30/republicans-shutdown-fight-exposes-simmering-civil-war.html" target="_blank">Dig this line of crap:</a></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I fully understand where the Tea Party and like-minded people are coming from, that Obamacare is a tragically flawed law and it&rsquo;s not good for the country, but I would also have to add that shutting down the government is not a good for the country,&rdquo; said Fred Malek, a Republican fundraiser.</p><p>&ldquo;At a time politically where Obama is in a very weak position resulting from his handling of the situation in Syria, the economic situation, and the implementation of a health-care law that is going to be really rocky, we&rsquo;re basically going in and seizing defeat from the jaws of victory politically,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a flawed law that&rsquo;s bad for the country being met with a flawed approach that is also very bad for the country, and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good politically or substantively.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wrong</span></strong>&nbsp;on all counts.</p><p>You are missing the point here Malek.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Republican Party "mainstream" no longer represents America <span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You have all stood for and allowed:</p><ul><li>The creation and expansion of medical <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">monopolies</span></strong>, including through the provision of Medicare Part D, CON laws <strong><em>and laws making crimes out of ordinary economic transactions</em></strong>&nbsp;such as buying a truckload of Viagra in another country and bringing it back to the United States, <strong><em>destroying</em></strong>&nbsp;the price controls that the drug companies have established. &nbsp;<strong>Price controls and restraint of trade are black-letter violations of The Sherman Act</strong>&nbsp;and you have made them <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">lawful</span></strong>. &nbsp;Never mind EMTALA (passed by none other than Ronald Reagan.)<br /><br /></li><li>The creation and expansion of a near-police-state empire with the "integration" of various records for all sorts of purposes, including NICS and more, <strong><em>all of which are used by employers and insurance companies to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">collude</span>&nbsp;in the offering (or refusal to offer) goods, services and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">jobs</span>&nbsp;to Americans.</em></strong>&nbsp; Again, but for government involvement and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">permission</span></strong>&nbsp;this would all be felonious.<br /><br /></li><li>The creation, sponsorship <strong><em>and passage</em></strong>&nbsp;of laws that have made student loan debt non-dischargeble <strong><em>along with the utter and blanket refusal to prosecute fraudulent credit emission by banks and others</em></strong>, and then you doubled down on that with a refusal to prosecute <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">outright fraud in the financial system</span></strong>&nbsp;during George Bush's time in office when it became evident and began to crash the markets and economy. &nbsp;Remember that it was <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span></strong>&nbsp;mainstream candidate who suspended his campaign in 2008 to guarantee the passage of TARP and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span></strong>&nbsp;Treasury Secretary who originally submitted a three-page bill <strong><em>that granted him effective status as emporer</em></strong>, removing <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span></strong>&nbsp;ability for oversight or prosecution <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">even for blatantly unlawful acts</span></strong>. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The outrageous support for illegal immigration and offshoring of jobs</strong>&nbsp;to nations that in turn <strong><em>prosecute</em></strong>&nbsp;or <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">heavily tax</span></strong>&nbsp;the same coming the other direction, resulting in the destruction of our wage and job base. &nbsp;China and Mexico are the worst two offenders. &nbsp;It is particularly galling when you realize that in China there is an <strong><em>import duty</em></strong>&nbsp;on iPhones due to some of the components and intellectual property coming from the US&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and yet the same device, assembled with parts made in China and in China itself with near-slave Chinese labor</span></strong>, flows here <strong><em>with no duty at all</em></strong>&nbsp;despite the destruction of manufacturing jobs that come from same. &nbsp;The same, incidentally, applies to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cars</span></strong>&nbsp;and their components (among others.)<br /><br /></li><li>All of the above has resulted in the destruction of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">80%</span></strong>&nbsp;of the minimum-wage-earners purchasing power since <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1980</span></strong>!</li></ul><p>Your party, Mr. Shit-for-brains, is why we're here. &nbsp;We no longer have an adversarial process in government <strong><em>as there is no longer a pair of political parties.</em></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>That a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">handful</span></strong>&nbsp;of people elected as Republicans have come to the conclusion that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the main you're just Democrats with a different letter after your name</span></strong>, with the only differentiating factor being your motivation (that is, Democrats want to steal and give to someone else while siphoning off part for themselves, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span></strong>&nbsp;want to steal and simply <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">keep it all yourself</span></strong>) is the first glimmer of reason I've seen in the political context in more than a decade.</p><p>To be blunt: The portion of America that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">actually produces</span></strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;tired of being ripped off.</p><p>Oh sure, the Democrats can still appeal to the thieves and their beneficiaries. &nbsp;But the problem they have is that without people like me, who are increasingly unwilling to pay the check and are erecting the middle finger,<strong><em>&nbsp;they can't fund their crap any more</em></strong>.</p><p>That the coalition of those who have had enough of this crap got enough people into office to make it impossible for you to move party-line-vote legislation <strong><em>without their consent</em></strong>&nbsp;and thus now have the ability to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">stop you</span></strong>&nbsp;is a public <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">good</span></strong>.</p><p>This much I'm reasonably sure of -- if you don't cut the crap and change your tune your ass is going to be living under a freeway overpass -- if you're lucky.</p><p>It will either happen because <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span></strong>&nbsp;reform and tear down all of the above (along with the rest) <strong><em>along with</em></strong>&nbsp;The Tea Party and those of us (like me) who are tired of your lies <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span></strong>&nbsp;an ever-increasing number of people will do what I'm doing, refusing to earn enough for you to keep taxing it away, <strong>and you will find that you have no choices at all as you won't be able to cash the checks you wish to write.</strong></p>

  <p>Can everyone in the media just STFU about the so-called "shutdown"?</p><p>Let's start with the first fact -- this isn't the first or only time that Congress has failed to achieve accord on a budget and the spending authority has expired. &nbsp;<strong>Indeed, that's exactly how the process is supposed to work when Congress cannot agree.</strong></p><p>Second, the less government does the less <strong><em>the better.</em></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Third, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></strong>&nbsp;government activity redirects that which, if the people wanted it, would otherwise be provided by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">someone</span></strong>&nbsp;in the private sector. &nbsp;Now it may be true that what the government does is the most-efficient means of doing "X" or it may not (mostly not, in my opinion) <strong><em>but it is not subject to dispute that in the general sense if there is demand for a given thing there will be supply at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">some price</span>, and that the market will determine that price <span style="text-decoration: underline;">absent interference</span></em></strong>.</p><p>Fourth, the medical system as it exists today <strong><em>only exists</em></strong>&nbsp;in a form a fashion that routinely bankrupts anyone who doesn't have the money of Bill Gates <strong><em>because</em></strong>&nbsp;of government. &nbsp;It could not be otherwise, because there would be no demand at the price charged <strong><em>but for the ability to shift the price to someone else.</em></strong>&nbsp; EMTALA is proof of this, as are laws <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">demanding</span></strong>&nbsp;a given service be provided "or else." &nbsp;There are many who claim this is all about "fairness" but that's a canard; there are very few (percentage-wise) rich people <strong><em>and if only the very wealthy could afford to pay the current charge for "X", where that is something like coronary artery surgery or an MRI, it would either (1) not exist for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">anyone</span>&nbsp;or (2) the price would come down.</em></strong></p><p>If open heart surgery costs $200,000 in the United States (at present it frequently does) <strong><em>but only 1 in every 1,000 people has $200,000</em></strong>&nbsp;then one of two things happens:</p><ul><li><strong>NOBODY</strong>&nbsp;gets that surgery because there are an insufficient number of people who can pay that price to support the necessary volume of surgeries to support both the surgeons and the facilities required to provide it <br /><br />OR<br /><br /></li><li><strong>The price comes down until a sufficient percentage of the population can afford the procedure.</strong></li></ul><p>Bankrupting more and more people is not only not the answer <strong><em>it can't work</em></strong>. &nbsp;Charging people <strong><em>who are not sick</em></strong>&nbsp;doesn't work either <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unless you stick a gun up their nose</span></strong>&nbsp;first, because they won't pay otherwise (why would you pay for something you don't need?)</p><p>The same thing has happened with so-called "higher education."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Let me be clear parents: If you "help" your kids go to college by co-signing for loans or otherwise participate in the current financial rape-job that is college education, including the FASFA and other related scams <em>you are fucking your kids up the ass.</em></strong></p><p>Why?</p><p>Because you are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">creating</span></strong>&nbsp;a world where the expectation is that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">everyone</span></strong>&nbsp;(or close to it) can and <strong><em>should</em></strong>&nbsp;go to college. &nbsp;That system now means that price will rise (and it has!) until it <strong><em>bankrupts</em></strong>&nbsp;as many people as possible without collapse. &nbsp;It means that <strong><em>a college degree becomes effectively required to work at Starbucks pulling coffees</em></strong>, even though that so-called "education" has <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">exactly nothing</span></strong>&nbsp;to do with performing that job.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your children</span></strong>&nbsp;who are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong>&nbsp;in the top 10% academically (which means 9 out of 10 of you) should <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">eat you</span></strong>&nbsp;for imposing this fraud on them <strong><em>and the other 10% should eat you as well</em></strong>&nbsp;because <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">their</span></strong>&nbsp;educational process costs 5x as much as it should <strong><em>and you caused that to be the case. &nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>You <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">stole</span></strong>&nbsp;either 80% of the money spent on their education <strong><em>or 100% of it</em></strong>&nbsp;in the case of the student who shouldn't have gone to college at all <strong><em>because what he or she does has no rational need for a college education!</em></strong></p><p>Let's quit kidding ourselves -- we need 10 bricklayers, coffee-pullers, burger-flippers, shelf-stockers and basic book-keepers for every rocket scientist. &nbsp;For everyone in the management office of a car company there are 10 who actually build and maintain the cars -- and those people need to understand how and why a torque wrench works and is necessary, <strong><em>not</em></strong>&nbsp;knowledge of Calculus and Organic Chemistry.</p><p>These two areas of our "economy" suck off an <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">enormous</span></strong>&nbsp;amount of our productive time and assets and have both been shoved up the ass of the American citizen at the behest of insurance companies, pharmaceutical firms and the educational lobby.</p><p>That we have 535 <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">assholes</span></strong>&nbsp;in Washington who are pandering to this crap and it has not resulted in 100 million Americans <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">swarming</span></strong>&nbsp;the Capitol and refusing to leave until <strong><em>all of this stops</em></strong>&nbsp;and the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">existing</span></strong>&nbsp;laws that prohibit monopolies and cartels are <strong><em>enforced</em></strong>&nbsp;is an outrage.</p><p>You may not know this but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">tomorrow</span></strong>&nbsp;your ability to buy health insurance will be limited to firms that are willing to sell coverage <strong><em>not state-wide</em></strong>&nbsp;but rather <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">only in your county</span></strong>. &nbsp;For a very large percentage of the <strong><em>counties</em></strong>&nbsp;in this country this means you will have exactly <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span></strong>&nbsp;choice -- a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">monopoly from whom you must buy</span></strong>&nbsp;or you will be penalized.</p><p>Read that again folks -- <strong><em>in many, and perhaps a majority of counties, there will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exactly one</span>&nbsp;company from whom you can buy so-called "health insurance."</em></strong>&nbsp; You will have exactly <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span></strong>&nbsp;choice as (1) you must buy it and (2) you cannot shop between different companies as only one will offer coverage in your county.</p><p>Yes, in many part of the country there will be more than one choice. &nbsp;But in many -- there will be exactly one.</p><p>Bluntly -- fuck that and fuck you Washington DC.</p>

  <p>In 2007 I began writing <em>The Market Ticker</em>&nbsp;due to the outrageous conduct of various branches in the Administration and portions of the Capital Markets. &nbsp;Endemic fraud in the financial system that had generated unbridled and outrageous credit creation threatened the collapse of our entire economic system.</p><p>The consequence of this should have been thousands of indictments, prosecutions and imprisonments -- of banking executives, of members of Congress, of various executive branch officers in various agencies and more. &nbsp;The banking system should have been forced to match assets to liabilities and either put up the margin to back their bets or liquidate them -- and if that forced them out of business and collapsed asset prices by 90%, so be it.</p><p>Instead our government took the easy way out. &nbsp;<strong><em>It doubled down on the fraudulent models of the past.</em></strong></p><p>But the models of the past were unsustainable and no amount of gaming arithmetic changes the outcome. &nbsp;Indeed, the laws of mathematics state that the longer you allow an exponential system to run away from you, the worse the correction to reality you must sustain is.</p><p>From 2007 to 2013 the government has grown from $2.7 trillion to $3.68 trillion, a 36% increase. Marketable federal debt has gone from $4.96 trillion to $12 trillion, up 120% (that is, more than a clean double.) &nbsp;</p><p>At the same time median family income has dropped from $56,000 to $52,000 <strong><em>in 2013 dollars</em></strong>&nbsp;(that is, adjusted for "inflation"), a roughly 7% <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">decrease</span></strong>.</p><p>Oh, and that's before taxes.</p><p>Everyone talks about there being a "tsunami" of incoming inflation to be expected. &nbsp;The real tsunami is government spending and debt&nbsp;<strong><em>and it already happened</em></strong>. &nbsp;In real-dollar terms the federal government <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">alone</span></strong>&nbsp;is taking from you nearly twice as much today as it was in 2007 and 80% of the minimum-wage-earner's buying power has been destroyed from 1980 to today.</p><p>And this is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span></strong>&nbsp;Obamacare really kicks in.</p><p>Then there are the outrageous actions of our government in Benghazi. &nbsp;What we are covering up there has not yet been determined with accuracy, but we don't need the fine details to understand the essence of the act. &nbsp;That our tax money was funding terrorists and other bad guys in some form or fashion, and that we were probably providing them <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">weapons</span></strong>&nbsp;is unfortunately pretty-much beyond dispute.</p><p>Never mind the outrageous and unconstitutional acts of the NSA in spying on people.</p><p>But perhaps the most-outrageous of all has been Obamacare and the medical "industry", which has used the power of government to utterly destroy any pretext of a fair and free market, creating a system where your medical care costs <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">five times or more</span></strong>&nbsp;what it should. &nbsp;That, incidentally, means that you should be able to pay cash for what your <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">deductible</span></strong>&nbsp;is on your insurance (including Medicare!) were that outrageously corrupt system to be exposed to the white-hot light of either the market, prosecution under the Sherman Act or both. &nbsp;Instead of making strides to resolve that outrage, no matter how small, Obama and Congress have doubled down with signature legislation <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">embodying in statute</span></strong>&nbsp;the utter financial <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">rape</span></strong>&nbsp;of our entire society and <strong><em>both sides of the aisle</em></strong>&nbsp;in Congress not only allowed it to happen <strong><em>but continue to allow it to proceed to this very day</em></strong>.</p><p>I've been a contributor to the government in the form of taxes my entire adult life. &nbsp;I've written plenty of checks to the IRS, some of which gave me writer's cramp. &nbsp;Never have I claimed a federal or state benefit check -- no food stamps, no welfare, no medicaid, nothing. &nbsp;<strong><em>But I have been poor enough to qualify earlier on in my life</em></strong>&nbsp;-- I was simply too proud to do it, and found some how, some way to not.</p><p>I have tolerated running a company in a state where an employee that was fired&nbsp;<em style="font-weight: bold;">for not showing up for work</em>&nbsp;was able to collect unemployment, along with several others fired for cause<em>.</em>&nbsp; I paid the increased rate of tax for what were <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">bogus</span></strong>&nbsp;claims on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">my</span></strong>&nbsp;account and which drove up <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">my</span></strong>&nbsp;tax rates. &nbsp;I complained, but I paid. &nbsp;I have put up with the ignobility of never actually <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">owning</span></strong>&nbsp;real estate, having to rent it <strong><em>every single year</em></strong>&nbsp;from the State and County governments, even though claiming that you have "ownership" of something that you then must pay to keep is an abject fraud. &nbsp;I have been "promised" both Social Security and Medicare even though it is mathematically impossible for me to ever receive them, and have paid taxes to support those programs for decades, while those who made the promises knowing they're false have never faced indictment, prosecution or imprisonment. &nbsp;I have watched our government reach its hands down the crotch of sick 80+ year old leukemia patients claiming they might be "terrorists" while at the same time a man who <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">states openly</span></strong>&nbsp;he attacked other Americans <strong><em>and killed them</em></strong>&nbsp;on a military base <strong><em>in the service of Islam</em></strong>&nbsp;is called an incident of "workplace violence" and those injured or killed are denied just recognition of being harmed <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in combat against a self-declared terrorist</span></strong>&nbsp;and/or taking heroic action to save others from same.</p><p>We all have our point at which we simply refuse to consent. &nbsp;A few, like Joe Stack, take that refusal and turn it into acts of violence. &nbsp;Singularly such acts are futile and amount to nothing more than martyrdom at best and a waste of human capital at worst.</p><p>But others, like myself, are unwilling to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">waste</span></strong>&nbsp;our lives. &nbsp;One can recognize there is a non-violent means of refusal that no government can counteract or put a stop to. &nbsp;It is far more effective and personally-satisfying than active, violent resistance, especially when the latter is singular and most of America is busy watching <em>Dancing With The Stars</em>, unworthy of anything more than being sheep to provide warmth for the "leaders" and occasionally a plate full of mutton.</p><p>Some of us have entrepreneurial ideas that might change the world. &nbsp;But the drivers for entrepreneurs are more complex than simply the satisfaction of seeing something we imagine come to fruition. &nbsp;For some it's simply the acquisition of wealth to the exclusion of everything else, but if I wanted to make that my focus in life I'd choose to be a bankster and figure out how to rip people off and get away with it. &nbsp;After all it's far easier to abuse leverage to rob people than it is to build things, in today's environment the odds of going to prison for doing it are somewhere between slim and none, and Slim left the bar an hour ago.</p><p>At the end of the day you have to be able to sleep with yourself every night. &nbsp;And unfortunately there can come a point where the cost-to-benefit ratio is simply all out of whack. &nbsp;I've been blessed with both industry and luck; via both I was able to answer the "do you have enough?" question in the affirmative close to twenty years ago. &nbsp;My motivating factors left the realm of making sure I could eat at that point and now the balance has unfortunately shifted to where what I do every day is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">work</span></strong>&nbsp;rather than <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">joy</span></strong>. &nbsp;</p><p>In no small part this shift is due to the zombie-like activity of many in this nation, including in places and among parts of the population where you'd think it would not be present.</p><p>I refuse to continue to silently accede to,&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and actively fund through my drive to acquire that measured in and rewarded by "wealth"</span></strong>,&nbsp;the rampant theft and fraud that has and continues to take place in the economic sector, especially in the banking and health care areas of our economy. &nbsp;None of this could <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ever</span></strong>&nbsp;exist except through the insertion of the guns of government up the noses of the American people. &nbsp;</p><p>I can no longer live with being one of the better sources of funding for these abuses. &nbsp;This decision did not come lightly, easily or quickly. &nbsp;But I'm convinced it's the right choice as things stand today.</p><p>In short, if you want it in two words, it's this: <strong>I'm done.</strong></p><p>I choose instead of either active participation through funding of our government's BS or violence to peacefully withdraw my consent. &nbsp;To refuse to labor. &nbsp;To make do with less -- a lot less. &nbsp;I choose to reduce my&nbsp;<strong>voluntary</strong>&nbsp;contribution to the tax hoard that is misspent or forms the foundation against which our government borrows, giving the proceeds to those who think that doping it up is a grand past-time or shoveling guns, missiles and money to terrorists while groping our grannies, using the very existence of the terrorists&nbsp;<strong><em>we gave the guns and missiles to</em></strong>&nbsp;as justification for what any civilized society would call sexual assault.</p><p>The portion of that which I earn by my efforts that I am able to retain in real terms shrinks by the day, and I have concluded that the balance of benefits and harms, <strong><em>especially the harms done to others using my tax dollars,</em></strong>&nbsp;is no longer acceptable to me.</p><p>My decision will not change until America changes. &nbsp;Until it wakes up. &nbsp;Until the people demand and the government of this county, this state and this nation recognize everyone's fundamental rights -- that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shall not be infringed</span></strong>&nbsp;means what it says, that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shall pass no law</span></strong>&nbsp;means what it says and all branches of government stop using taxpayer dollars to arm terrorists, maintain and promote medical monopolies, promote and empower banking cartels while excusing violence and fraud, both financial and corporeal, committed against the people of this nation by those entities and the agents of government itself.&nbsp;</p><p>I have seen enough frauds committed by and with the active involvement of government to become convinced that this is what, in the main, my tax dollars are buying. &nbsp;Whether it be Angela Corey's apparent intentional withholding of evidence from George Zimmerman's counsel (<a href="http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/conscience-realist/2013/sep/17/zimmerman-prosecutor-angela-corey-now-under-state-/" target="_blank">and now her firing of one of the people who tried to do the right thing</a>), the rip-off of pension funds and the taxpayer through both looting of the funds and ridiculously over-promised rates of return or the literal <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">thousands</span></strong>&nbsp;of citizens that have had their homes foreclosed upon through blatantly fraudulent process and perjured documents, enough is enough.</p><p>I will not accept mere political promises as they are rubber checks without a penalty for being fraudulently issued and over the last 20 years they have&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span></strong>&nbsp;bounced. &nbsp;I instead demand action, indictments, prosecutions, break-ups of monopolies, impeachments, business closures, the end of deficit spending and reform. These are not discussion points, they are demands. &nbsp;They are demands that I have every right to make because it is with the fruits of my hand and mind that this government has foisted upon the American people these frauds, costs and harms. &nbsp;I have written too many large checks to the IRS over the years only to see this crap not only continue but accelerate in the harm done to our nation -- and especially our youth.</p><p>I hope, pray for and encourage others to also peacefully withdraw their consent. &nbsp;If enough of us who are the producers in this nation do so then government will have no choice but to bow to our will or collapse. &nbsp;My decision in this regard, if ratified by concurrence of just a small percentage of the population, represents what I believe is the only remaining lawful and peaceful way to accomplish that goal.</p><p>If there are an insufficient number of others willing to also participate then my personal conviction that it is unacceptable to fund the screwing of others, whether it be financially or through actual acts of violence, will be demonstrated to be that of a tiny minority.</p><p>I accept that this is not only possible, it's likely.</p><p>But should that be the case then this nation does not deserve to survive as a Constitutional Republic -- <strong>and in the end, it will not, becoming something much darker, uglier and unworthy of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span>&nbsp;of my support.</strong></p><p>There is only one way to know which of the two possibilities is true -- and that is to act, and see who also acts. &nbsp;To lead not through exhortation (or worse, extortion)&nbsp;<strong><em>but rather by example.</em></strong> &nbsp;To see who chooses to not only continue to consent <strong><em>but actively supports</em></strong>&nbsp;the murder of others, physical violence served upon those who simply wish to enjoy their unalienable rights and the financial rape of our own citizens en-masse --&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">especially</span></strong>&nbsp;our children and young adults.</p><p>If and when things change I will reconsider my position and lower my middle finger.</p><p>But not before.</p><p>I therefore choose to reduce the ability of our government to tax my income to as close to an effective zero as I can reasonably achieve in keeping with what I enjoy doing, which is putting before the people a chronology of lies, frauds and scams in the hope that others wake up.</p><p>But I will do so on my terms, not someone else's.</p><p>Therefore, <em>Tickerforum's</em>&nbsp;donor program has been closed, effective today. &nbsp;Existing gold donor privileges will remain active through their expiration date -- or 12/31, the latest a quarterly donor could expect them to remain active (and the longest donation formally permitted since mid-2010.) &nbsp;Those who set up recurring donations have had their profiles canceled at PayPal. &nbsp;</p><p>For those who wish to comment and discuss politically-related topics the politics areas will remain fully-accessible for the present time.</p><p>The formerly-anticipated newsletter, coding for which is in fact complete and ready to go, will <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong>&nbsp;be launched. &nbsp;My personal activity in the markets and otherwise, including entrepreneurship, will for nearly all intents and purposes cease by the end of the year.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Market Ticker</strong></span>&nbsp;will continue to operate in an advertising-supported format but other than macro-level economic reports (e.g. the payroll report, Z1, etc) you will find the balance shifts toward less market-related material and more politically-related material -- simply because I have withdrawn from market-related activity beyond the macro level. &nbsp;There will be fewer articles, and many days with none at all -- a rarity up until now. &nbsp;Old articles will disappear from public view, a change recently implemented and one now filtering through the various Internet archives as they "refresh" their links.</p><p>Finally, for those who argue that I should become more involved in political pursuits, no matter what they may be, I will answer your question in advance and save you the time you'd otherwise use to solicit me for such purposes: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No</span></strong>.</p><p>On a net basis this should reduce my "income footprint" to be within the<strong> "Screw You Uncle Sam"</strong> range. &nbsp;The comment capacity on <em>The Ticker</em>&nbsp;will be commensurately reduced, as I have observed that for the most part those who are not donors to the system comprise the vast majority of inane (or worse) comments. &nbsp;But for those who can form a cogent opinion and use logic, your input to the discussion will still be possible.</p><p>The activities that I choose to undertake in the entrepreneurship area will all be of a long-term capital gain in nature, where the government is able to garner little of what I come up with, and then only on my schedule, not theirs -- a schedule that may well be "never" if I so choose and there is no reform.</p><p>It is time for those of us who care to direct our energies in a different way, and I know of no better means of laying that forward than through personal example.</p><p><strong>For whatever you deem it to be worth, here's my example.</strong></p>

  <p>You know me too, Frank -- we met at McStain's campaign shindig at the University Club in Washington DC in the summer of 2008. &nbsp;I recall that you and Governor Ridge both refused to take a stand on all the <strong><em>frauds</em></strong>&nbsp;in the mortgage market -- the very frauds that just a couple of months later led to the failure of Lehman, the market crash in general and the ensuing disaster.</p><p>It figures that you're now the President and chief executive of the American Bankers Association. &nbsp;<strong>It must be really, really awesome to have your candidate suspend his campaign in order to bail out a bunch of jackasses and then get <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rewarded</span>&nbsp;for that with the left seat.</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/defaulting-on-us-debt-cant-be-an-option/2013/09/27/deaf2580-26f7-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html?wpmk=MK0000203" target="_blank">So it is with much disdain that I am about to skullfuck you for this piece of crap -- or shall we just call it a wholesale lie -- you got published in the Washington Post:</a></p><blockquote><p>In this country, our word is our bond.

Ordinary Americans will bear the brunt of the damage if our leaders don&rsquo;t prevent the United States from defaulting on its debt for the first time in history.</p></blockquote><p>That's a bald-faced, knowing lie.</p><p>A refusal to raise the debt ceiling is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong>&nbsp;a default.</p><p><strong>A default would be the refusal to pay the interest and principal (or roll over the latter) when it came due. &nbsp; <em>Refusing to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">borrow more money</span>&nbsp;is not a default any more than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span>&nbsp;refusal to ask for an increased credit line on your VISA card when you reach that limit, or a refusal to take out a HELOC against your house so you can spend even more than you make, is a default.</em></strong></p><p>But more to the point there are two sorts of defaults -- voluntary (where you simply erect the middle finger toward your creditor) and involuntary (where you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">can't</span></strong>&nbsp;make the payments on a cash-flow basis.)</p><p><strong>The day our interest cost and "mandatory" spending that we have given priority by law exceeds tax revenues our default has become <span style="text-decoration: underline;">involuntary</span>.</strong></p><p>That day is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in fact here</span></strong>&nbsp;because we continue to pile up debt at a rate that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">exceeds</span></strong>&nbsp;the income of the nation from which those payments must come.</p><p>A decision to stop that, which is what a refusal to raise the debt ceiling constitutes, is a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">good</span></strong>&nbsp;and <strong><em>fiscally-responsible</em></strong>&nbsp;act. &nbsp;It will force on an immediate basis a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">balanced budget</span></strong>&nbsp;where Congress and the Executive can spend <strong><em>only that which it is able to tax. &nbsp;</em></strong>That in turn will <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">force</span></strong>&nbsp;a reduction in both mandatory and discretionary spending to a level where that, plus interest payments, are covered by tax receipts.</p><p>But there's even more crap that Keating spewed than his first lie in this piece, and the worst of it is here:</p><blockquote><p>Beyond the enormous cost to taxpayers, even the slightest uptick in Treasury interest rates would cascade through the economy.</p></blockquote><p><strong>That change is coming whether you like it or not. &nbsp;It is simple arithmetic -- nobody intentionally lends at a loss, <em>and the steady downward path for interest rates, a 30 year cycle, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is coming to an end</span>&nbsp;</em>irrespective of whether you or anyone else approves of same because the purchasing power destruction that occurs in a fiat currency world when you increase the denominator (supply of currency and credit) <em>cannot continue on a permanent basis without lenders coming to their senses and ceasing to allow you to borrow at a net negative rate of interest</em>.</strong></p><blockquote><p>Using the debt ceiling as leverage in the deficit debate is unwise and dangerous. Citizens nationwide are frustrated with the political stalemate in Washington. But our nation&rsquo;s financial integrity should not be used as a bargaining chip.</p></blockquote><p>It is not a "bargaining chip" -- it is a statement that <strong>we, the people of this nation, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">demand</span>&nbsp;that the government of this country <em>spend only what it is able to tax</em>&nbsp;and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pay down</span>&nbsp;the debt already accumulated.</strong></p><p>Since neither political party will do this "voluntarily" <strong>one of them, the Republicans, have taken to forcing the issue by refusing to increase the borrowing capacity of the government in an effort to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">begin</span>&nbsp;the process of rationalizing the cash flow statement and balance sheet of this nation's government.</strong></p><p>This is a good thing, it should be allowed to stand, and the government should be <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">forced</span></strong>&nbsp;to live within its ability to tax.</p><p>Confidence in the ability of our nation to pay its debts on time is not "lost" by refusing to borrow more money. &nbsp;</p><p>Quite to the contrary -- <strong><em>confidence in the ability of our nation's ability to pay its debts will be permanently and irrevocably lost at the point where mandatory (entitlement) spending + military spending exceeds tax revenues.</em></strong></p><p>Well you might want to look at the numbers Mr. Keating, because Pensions, Health Care and Defense total to about $2.7 trillion for FY13. &nbsp;</p><p>Income and Social Insurance taxes total approximately..... $2.7 trillion. &nbsp;</p><p>How much does that leave for <strong><em>interest</em></strong>&nbsp;payments?</p><p><strong>What was that you were saying about default again?</strong></p>

John McCain has hired a controversial Syria analyst who recently was fired by one D.C. organization and resigned from another after it emerged that she inflated her academic credentials.</p><p>The Republican senator's office confirmed to Fox News that Elizabeth O'Bagy was hired as a legislative assistant, and will start work next week</p></blockquote><p>O'Bagy (now <strong><em>that's</em></strong>&nbsp;an interesting name) was fired, if you remember, after she claimed she had a PhD that not only did she not have <strong><em>she had never applied for.</em></strong>&nbsp; She didn't just lie once, she lied twice -- first in claiming that she had the degree, then <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">again</span></strong>&nbsp;when caught in claiming that she had submitted all of the work (including her thesis) but was awaiting the final award -- a colorable argument <strong><em>if it was true</em></strong>.</p><p>The problem turned out to be that this claim was a lie as well.</p><p>McStain, for his part, is an utter embarassment to this nation and our Senate. &nbsp;It is precisely Senators like him, and there are several in number, who define everything that is wrong with this nation's government at present. &nbsp;Not only is this man a warmonger he has the personal ethical values of a snake; if you recall he divorced his wife <strong><em>who had remained married despite the fact that he was imprisoned in a POW camp and was reasonably expected to die there</em></strong>&nbsp;after <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">she</span></strong>&nbsp;suffered debilitating injuries in an auto accident. &nbsp;Instead, he married the heir to a large beer distributor <strong><em>and his new, wealthy (and both beautiful and fully physically-able) wife largely funded his entry into the Senate.</em></strong></p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Remember too that this so-called "maverick" of the Senate has claimed to be against corrupting influences in government. &nbsp;<strong><em>This is why he wants Obamacare to remain the law of the land and be funded, because it will dramatically reduce monopoly controls and corruption in health care, right? &nbsp;</em></strong>Oh wait -- that's not true at all -- it will instead dramatically <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">increase</span></strong>&nbsp;both, with the most-glaring example being that on the implementation date your options to buy health insurance will decrease from <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">state-wide</span></strong>&nbsp;shopping to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">county-wide</span></strong>&nbsp;options, and in many counties the options from which you will be able to buy that insurance will be limited to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span></strong>.</p><p>Hmmm.... another lie.</p><p>In fact you can't swing a dead cat around by the tail without running into one of McCain's lies in the political sphere. &nbsp;He uses his military service and the fact that he was a POW and tortured while in custody in the same sort of way that Obama uses his race -- as a foil to allow him to take utterly outrageous positions and promote them, even when they border on <strong><em>treason</em></strong>&nbsp;(such as supporting the arming of Syrian rebels <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">with known ties to Al Qaida</span></strong>, a group that not only swears to be an enemy of our nation <strong><em>but which we have formally declared an enemy in our Congress</em></strong>.)</p><p>That self-declared "men" like this manage to hold their seats despite decades-long records in public office that document their own outrageous behavior is all the evidence anyone needs to declare that we no longer have a Constitutional Republic nor any honor among its various branches of government.</p><p>O'Bagy will fit right in with McCrapStain's MO and should prove to be a fine addition to his staff.</p>

Note that from birth to 18 while the relationship may have an essentially parasitic character to it <strong><em>there is a quid-pro-quo</em></strong>&nbsp;that we return to our kids. &nbsp;You can argue over whether this is just but not whether it's necessary, since an infant is physically incapable of survival and growth without outside assistance.</p><p>That transition from a power relationship to one of equals, even friends, is one that is supposed to happen over time from birth to emancipation. &nbsp;It is in fact our <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">jobs</span></strong>&nbsp;as parents -- our only job -- to execute on that.</p><p>But we've become pigs.</p><p>We're not content to perform that task and discharge our responsibilities. &nbsp;When we discovered that we can't force our now-18 year olds to mow the lawn any more in exchange for an allowance, <strong>we then passed laws that tax them to cover our health care after we chose to be gluttonous jackasses, poisoning our bodies and then demanding the latest, most-expensive medical care that we cannot pay for ourselves. &nbsp;Worse, we let government and the "educational monopoly" design a system that is utterly rapacious and designed to screw our youth through uneconomic options sold to them as the "essential" educational background necessary for success.</strong></p><p>Sure, there are exceptions. &nbsp;Some can claim those exceptions <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">personally</span></strong>, but damn few can claim them <strong><em>socially</em></strong>. &nbsp;While you may <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">claim</span></strong>&nbsp;you don't want to burden <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span></strong>&nbsp;children <strong>you still continue to vote for, support and allow government to continue to fuck <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the next door neighbor's kid</span>&nbsp;to get what you claim you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">deserve</span></strong>.</p><p>And don't tell me it matters if you're Democrat, Republican, Libertarian or otherwise. &nbsp;It does not. &nbsp;The fact of the matter is that no government can exist without the consent of the governed and no government can issue debt successfully if the people refuse to labor and thus provide something that creditors can rely on for repayment.</p><p><strong>By going on strike en-masse we have the ability to stop all of this stupidity, from top to bottom. </strong></p><p>But we won't do it because we are<em><strong>&nbsp;afraid</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p><p>And in response to that fear, <strong><em>instead of standing up to what we've done and accepting that we must take <span style="text-decoration: underline;">risk</span>&nbsp;in order to right what the wrongs <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we committed</span>&nbsp;</em>we instead choose to financially rape and enslave <span style="text-decoration: underline;">those young adults we brought into this world</span>, as if we bred them to be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">our slaves</span>&nbsp;from the outset.</strong></p><p>If you're wondering why I believe we deserve to be eaten -- or our youth simply shut down and refuse to make their best effort -- read the above paragraph as many times as you need to until it sinks in.</p><p><em>'Nuff said.</em></p>

They laid out a case showing that a new encryption standard, given a stamp of approval by the U.S. government, possessed a glaring weakness that made an algorithm in it susceptible to cracking. But the weakness they described wasn&rsquo;t just an average vulnerability, it had the kind of properties one would want if one were intentionally inserting a backdoor to make the algorithm susceptible to cracking by design.</p></blockquote><p>PRNG = Random number generator.</p><p>This is exactly where I said you'd put such a weakness, if you were inclined to.</p><p>Why?</p><p><strong>Because it's the "easiest" point of attack for modern cryptography short of threatening to drill the keyholder's hand.</strong></p><p>The amusing part? &nbsp;Bruce Schneier, one of the folks with impeccable credentials in the cryptography world, said this:</p><blockquote><p><span>Schneier called it &ldquo;scary stuff indeed,&rdquo; but he also said at the time that it made no sense as a backdoor, since it was so obvious to anyone who looked at the algorithm and standard that there was this flaw in it.</span></p></blockquote><p>In other words -- you'd be an <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">idiot</span></strong>&nbsp;to include this unless someone demanded it <strong><em>and you'd be even more dumb to make it a default.</em></strong></p><p>Well, an awful lot of people <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">did</span></strong>&nbsp;include it. &nbsp;But not very many set it as the default.</p><blockquote><p><span>&ldquo;This is the worst problem that the NSA has done,&rdquo; Schneier says. &ldquo;They have so undermined the fundamental trust in the internet, that we don&rsquo;t know what to trust. We have to suspect everything. We&rsquo;re never sure. That&rsquo;s the greatest damage.&rdquo;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Yep.</span></p><p>And this is why the company that decides to be <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">completely open</span></strong>&nbsp;with their cryptographic implementations <strong><em>across the board</em></strong>&nbsp;(including in handsets, tablets and similar) has a big fat wedge they can drive into the market -- both with consumers <strong><em>and more-importantly with business customers.</em></strong></p>

Just 28 percent of respondents backed Obama&rsquo;s call for a clean bill that has no add-on provisions.</p></blockquote><p>Well well.</p><p>I wonder how much of this is being driven by the average American that has been hammered into the ground by the so-called "compassion" of Washington over the last several years -- not to mention zero-interest rates.</p><p>We have a serious problem in this country (and worldwide in fact) among <em>homo sapiens</em>&nbsp;-- we seem to be utterly incapable of grasping the exponential function <strong><em>intuitively</em></strong>. &nbsp;Even after we've been taught it in school, and graphed it on paper a whole host of times from middle school on through college, <strong><em>in general people just don't get it.</em></strong></p><p>Specifically, they don't get the fact that <strong><em>any two exponential functions, where one has a larger exponent than the other, will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inevitably</span>&nbsp;run away from one another at an ever-increasing rate.</em></strong></p><p>People also seem to be utterly incapable of grasping that the so-called "prosperity" of the last 30 years was in fact <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">fake</span></strong>&nbsp;-- that it was driven by an ever-decreasing cost of borrowing money, and that <strong><em>secular environment</em></strong>&nbsp;simply <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot</span></strong>&nbsp;continue forever.</p><p>When it ends the "benign" outcome is that rates flat-line at or near zero <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">for an extended period of time</span></strong>. &nbsp;That outcome, if we experience it, <strong><em>stops the faux "economic progress" dead in its tracks</em></strong>&nbsp;as you can no longer use the decrease in rates to add to the amount you borrow <strong><em>while maintaining the interest payments at the same amount of money in dollars.</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>That's the core problem -- we've done this for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">30 years</span></strong>&nbsp;and tried to claim we're "growing" and experiencing "economic progress." &nbsp;That's a lie. &nbsp;The vast majority of the country, <strong><em>in fact 90% or more of the people</em></strong>, have experienced nothing of the sort. &nbsp;They either have <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">personally</span></strong>&nbsp;borrowed more and more (witness all the rage over refinancing home mortgages -- just look at the mortgage reports every week!) while trying to take advantage of falling rates or they have the government do it for them, handing out the proceeds through "entitlements" and welfare of various sorts.</p><p>Indeed, many so-called "rich" are not really rich at all. &nbsp;When one takes their actual assets and subtracts out their borrowings they suddenly aren't so wealthy. &nbsp;They have enough assets that access to the "infinite rollover game" is <strong><em>personally</em></strong>&nbsp;actionable by them (witness the ads for certain brokerages that will "lend $1 million on a $200,000 portfolio at under 2%!") -- strategies that look <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">great</span></strong>&nbsp;right up until something goes wrong and you experience the pain of descending from being wealthy to broke in 30 seconds.</p><p>The "ascent" of stock prices in the last several years has been a manifestation of this poisonous environment writ large. &nbsp;As in 1999 and early 2000 the markets are rising <strong><em>on the backs of firms that have no earnings and no <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rational</span>&nbsp;prospect for ever returning a decent amount of capital to shareholders predicated on their ongoing operations.</em></strong>&nbsp; Oh sure, there are claims that these "business models" will change the world, just as pets.com was going to back then. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>The claims are at best delusions and at worst open and abject frauds.</strong></p><p>Yet so long as "free money" appears to be available <strong><em>prices can continue to rise.</em></strong></p><p>The problem is that there is no such thing as "free money." &nbsp;What has been called "free money" <strong><em>is in fact nothing more than turning the leverage crank and adding ever-greater amounts of indebtedness while maintaining the so-called "affordability" since the interest payments remain the same.</em></strong></p><p>But liabilities are liabilities and the bad news is that while <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">assets</span></strong>&nbsp;are always subject to the perceived valuation of others (after all, in order to reduce one to cash you must find someone that will exchange that asset for cash) <strong><em>liabilities are always known to the penny</em></strong>&nbsp;because the party on the other side of the transaction <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">insists</span></strong>&nbsp;on various forms of contractual obligation to insure that happens.</p><p>We <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span></strong>&nbsp;deal with the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">false</span></strong>&nbsp;claims that have been made by both government and private actors in this regard. &nbsp;It's difficult to do, as there are very wealthy people who will be <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">much</span></strong>&nbsp;less-so if and when that conversation takes place. &nbsp;All those expensive bank buildings didn't magically appear -- they were built because <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span></strong>&nbsp;transferred your wealth to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">them</span></strong>, and it happened to a large degree <strong><em>because the people in those buildings lied to you both individually and through collusion with governments at all levels -- local, state and federal.</em></strong></p><p>The day those buildings are razed and banking goes back to a community relationship <strong><em>that is not predicated on rolling over debt</em></strong>&nbsp;but rather is a single-ended transaction that terminates with you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">owning</span></strong>&nbsp;the asset in question once payments are made in full, we will be more-or-less back to reality.</p><p>We're nowhere near that point today and so long as we permit governments to do things like assert perpetual claims through property taxes (which only "works" as long as that ever-growing leverage can be increased) along with refusing to run a government <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">surplus</span></strong>, dispensing only those funds that are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">first</span></strong>&nbsp;paid in via taxes, <strong><em>we are still going the wrong way as a nation and a people and all of it is happening <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with your explicit consent</span></em></strong>.</p>

U.S. Special Forces undergo significant training to operate these vehicles.

(Multiple times, in fact, if they were users before and after the change to the Lightning dock connector, which rendered 30-pin dock connectors obsolete.)</p></blockquote><p>Oh, and for those who thought they'd turn that rape into only half-a-rape and buy a third-party cable?</p><p>Apple "fixed" you in IOS7 (without warning you first) -- they turned all those third-party cables <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">into worthless pieces of string</span></strong>&nbsp;with the IOS7 upgrade.</p><p>So if you have an iPhone 5 and bought a third-party charger cable to evade the AppleRapeJob, the company's <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">one-way</span></strong>&nbsp;"software upgrade" just destroyed your investment.</p><p>This is the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">second</span></strong>&nbsp;time Apple has done this. &nbsp;The first time was with standard USB chargers. &nbsp;The standard way for a USB power source to indicate that it can put out more than 500ma (the standard for a port that is on a computer) is to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">short</span></strong>&nbsp;the data pins. &nbsp;This is easily read, of course, and since a charger is just a voltage source (5V, to be specific in this case) that's easy and requires no intelligence in the charger itself.</p><p>Apple, never satisfied to use what had been done by others, <strong><em>changed this</em></strong>&nbsp;for their chargers for the iPad and iPhone. &nbsp;They used a differential voltage scheme on the data pins <strong><em>instead of the already-established standard</em></strong>, which appears coldly calculated to screw you if you plug in a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">non-Apple</span></strong>&nbsp;product to those chargers made for Apple devices -- that device will only charge at 500ma since it doesn't see the expected short on the data pins. &nbsp;This became important with phones in cars being used for navigation because with the GPS and data up most of them draw more than 500ma -- <strong><em>as a result a standard 500ma charger -- or one built to be "nice" with Apple's devices -- will actually result in the phone <span style="text-decoration: underline;">losing charge</span>&nbsp;when navigating!</em></strong></p><p>That little game looked very intentional to me -- Apple could have simply used the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">existing</span></strong>&nbsp;standard. &nbsp;By not doing so they destroyed what was a cohesive market for in-car high-rate chargers.</p><p>But this is worse, because they're putting a chip in their "Lightning" cables which are proprietary to Apple. &nbsp;And without one you get the warning, or worse, <strong><em>the phone lies</em></strong>&nbsp;and doesn't charge at all (or does so at such a low rate that you'll believe the charger is broken.)</p><p><strong>If you keep buying products from this company you are an iDiot!</strong></p><p>PS: A high-quality, coiled-cord, full-2A+ car cord for the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">standard</span></strong>&nbsp;microUSB charging port on virtually everything else can be had for under $12. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/ACC-48181-301-Blackberry-Premium-In-Vehicle-MicroUSB/dp/B0089QK4NK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380115121&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=blackberry+premium+charger" target="_blank">Name brand too</a>, with a second USB port so if you want to charge or power two devices at once -- you can. &nbsp;I own two of them (one for each car) and they absolutely <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">rock</span></strong>.</p>

Wellington Wimpy behavior due to a 30-year <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">secular decline</span></strong>&nbsp;in interest rates. &nbsp;If you borrowed $10,000 at 10% interest and the rate of interest drops to 8%, you can roll over that debt and borrow $12,000 <strong><em>but pay the same interest you paid on $10,000 before.</em></strong>&nbsp; If the rate of interest then falls to 6% you can roll it over again <strong>and borrow another $4,000, or $16,000 total,</strong>&nbsp;while keeping the same payment. &nbsp;If the rate of interest then falls to 4% you can now roll it <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">again</span></strong>&nbsp;and borrow $24,000, or <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">$8,000</span></strong>&nbsp;more while keeping the same interest payment! &nbsp;And finally, when the 10 year rate falls to 2% you can borrow <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">$48,000</span></strong>&nbsp;and pay the same interest.</p><p><img src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/DGS10_Max_630_378.png" alt="" width="512" height="307" /></p><p>Note that you've got nearly <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">five times</span></strong>&nbsp;as much borrowed money out as you did when the interest rate was 10%; you are paying only the interest.</p><p>This is how we've "accomplished" our so-called "economic growth." &nbsp;<strong><em>It was all a lie because the debt was never paid down -- only the interest was paid. &nbsp;Both corporations and governments have engaged in this lie and many individuals have tried to do so as well.</em></strong></p><p>But rates cannot go below zero since people can <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">choose</span></strong>&nbsp;to not lend and when someone doesn't get paid but rather gets <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">charged</span></strong>&nbsp;to lend they will choose not to. &nbsp;</p><p>The Fed's QE game is in fact a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">scam</span></strong>&nbsp;and an <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">abject fraud</span></strong>&nbsp;in an attempt to cover up <strong><em>that which they have powered forward in concert with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and at the behest of</span>&nbsp;the Congress.</em></strong></p><p>Read that however many times you need to until it sinks in. &nbsp;<strong>The Fed isn't the problem -- Congress is. &nbsp;Congress passed the law that created The Fed. &nbsp;Congress has willfully and intentionally <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ignored</span>&nbsp;the Fed's violation of its own charter on a serial basis for the entire period of time&nbsp;<em>because that fraud is what makes possible <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Congress</span>&nbsp;spending more than it takes in via taxes.</em></strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Congress</span>&nbsp;is a serial and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">outrageous</span>&nbsp;abuser of the monetary authority vested in it by The Constitution and for this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every single member</span>&nbsp;deserves to be removed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and prosecuted</span>&nbsp;for fraud.</strong></p><p>The so-called "economic growth" produced by this process has been <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">faked</span></strong>&nbsp;and the 2008 crash <strong><em>exposed</em></strong>&nbsp;that fact to the world. &nbsp;In a puerile (and ultimately futile) attempt to prevent the unwind of that debt leverage <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Congress</span></strong>&nbsp;conspired with The Administration (Bush at the time, Obama now) to both pass TARP <strong>and then ignore the willful and intentional lies Bernanke has serially told before Congress both before and since</strong>.</p><p>Note that not <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span></strong>&nbsp;question about this very simple arithmetic <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">fact</span></strong>&nbsp;up above has been put forward during any of Bernanke's so-called "testimony." &nbsp;Not even by the so-called "crusader" Ron Paul during his time in Congress.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>Because if it is <strong><em>this entire house of cards comes down instantly.</em></strong></p><p>But arithmetic doesn't care about politics.</p><p>It just is.</p><p>And if you want to know what happens when you ignore exponential functions, <a href="akcs-www?post=196155" target="_blank">read this <em>Ticker</em>&nbsp;again.</a></p><p>And then consider that now, nearly two years later, <strong><em>although it appears there remains plenty of "blue sky" over our heads</em></strong>, there in fact <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">is not</span></strong>.</p>

I then <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">publish</span></strong>&nbsp;the source code to the crypto modules along with cryptographic checksums of the binaries. &nbsp;This allows <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">anyone</span></strong>&nbsp;to verify that the source is in fact the binary and has <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong>&nbsp;been tampered with. &nbsp;If there are holes found by that public review, we fix them -- immediately and publicly. &nbsp;Zero cost.<br /><br /></li><li>I <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">immediately</span></strong>&nbsp;push out an update for BB10 that enables <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">S/MIME</span></strong>&nbsp;email for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all users</span></strong>, not just BES10 users. &nbsp;<strong>Now BB10 devices are the only ones in the market with end-to-end&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">secure</span>&nbsp;email out of the box. &nbsp;</strong>Period. &nbsp;This is a zero-effort and cost update since the code is <strong><em>already in the handsets. &nbsp;</em></strong>S/MIME, incidentally, is cross-compatible with virtually everything in the corporate world, most-particularly Outlook.<strong><em><br />&nbsp;</em></strong></li><li>I <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">immediately</span></strong>&nbsp;push out an update for BB10 that enables <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Balance</span></strong>&nbsp;without BES10. &nbsp;Now people who want to separate work and personal use of their phones <strong><em>privately </em></strong>can do so. &nbsp;<strong><em>This is again a unique feature</em></strong>&nbsp;that nobody else has <strong>and again it's zero cost.<em><br />&nbsp;</em></strong></li><li><strong>Between these three changes I now have the only "non-interceptable" device for email out-of-the-box that interoperates with all the major corporate email systems and the only one with the ability to have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two distinct personal partitions</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;on the market. &nbsp;BB10 already has strong encryption for the phone's storage (and separately for the SD card if you wish) as well. &nbsp;That becomes my marketing message: &nbsp;"<em>If you want security and choice, buy BlackBerry devices. &nbsp;If you don't care, buy our competitor's products.</em>" &nbsp;That becomes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span>&nbsp;formal (and not quiet either) message that the market receives about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">why</span>&nbsp;you want BlackBerry.<em><br /><br /></em></strong></li><li>I <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">immediately</span></strong>&nbsp;change the Android runtime so as to permit permissions to be toggled off <strong><em>and default them all off.</em></strong>&nbsp; When you load an Android app repackaged as a BAR file the system now brings up a screen with all the requested permissions off and you have to turn them <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">on</span></strong>. &nbsp;Include very explicit warnings for the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">dangerous</span></strong>&nbsp;permissions at the same time and <strong><em>strongly recommend</em></strong>&nbsp;that the user <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong>&nbsp;enable them.<br /><br /></li><li>I go after the PlayStore and Android <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hard</span></strong>. &nbsp;The "fake" BBM applications are all that is necessary to drive a big fat 2x6 up Android's ass. &nbsp;Run an ad with a guy accidentally loading one of those fake apps as an administrator in a hospital and then watching in horror as his patient database gets immediately uploaded to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">China</span></strong>. &nbsp;Bawhahahaa.. &nbsp;One 30 second ad and they're <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">done</span></strong>. &nbsp;That ad would go viral <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">instantly</span></strong>.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>I go directly to the carriers and explain to them that I'm well-aware that they hate us -- their actions prove it. &nbsp;I also am well-aware that my competitors have managed to sucker them into penalty clauses for slow sales on my competition's products, which would be a problem for me <strong><em>even if they didn't hate us</em></strong>. &nbsp;All's fair in love, war and business, and this is business. &nbsp;Therefore the bottom line is that since I have FCC IDs for my devices and that's all I need, I'm going to sell direct and unlocked, and I'm <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">also</span></strong>&nbsp;going to allow customers to load the newest firmware at their discretion off my servers without carrier interference. &nbsp;If and when the carriers would like to promote my devices and act like partners then I'm interested in discussing it on non-discriminatory terms. &nbsp;After all, in exchange for support and promotion they deserve a margin. &nbsp;But until they'll provide that and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong>&nbsp;undermine my product offerings&nbsp;I have <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">exactly zero</span></strong>&nbsp;reason to give up one dollar of margin on the hardware to the carriers.<br /><br />In short I'm well-aware that perhaps the viewpoint that the carriers have based on prior behavior when there was only BlackBerry may be well-founded, but it wasn't BlackBerry that got them to sign agreements to sell "X" worth of "Y" branded phones or pay a penalty, and I'll be double-damned if they're going to damage my firm because they did something stupid. &nbsp;Nor am I going to provide them with a margin on hardware sales when they lie to customers, try to talk them into buying competitors' products and piss them off when it comes to support, <strong><em>all of which they have actively done for the last year</em></strong>. &nbsp;Further, I know full well what RICO is and if there is active interference with my sales and customer's use of devices on those carrier networks I'll use that law aggressively, including its criminal provisions and I won't be quiet about it either.<br /><br />If the carriers don't want to support the devices that's fine -- we will do it ourselves and we will market our devices as the secure alternative for those who are tired of carriers who have rolled over and played lapdog to governments demanding customer location and use information without so much as a lawsuit in response&nbsp;<strong>for more than a decade</strong>. &nbsp;And we'll keep all of the margin on the hardware, since we're doing all the work. <br /><br />Oh, and if you think that won't work, yes it will. &nbsp;All the carriers are being forced by the market into non-contract environments. &nbsp;<strong><em>The ability to force customers to pay subsidies via back-door pricing in the service plans is either gone or ending, </em></strong>and exposing <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span></strong>&nbsp;will be part of our marketing message too. I bet all those customers will think it's just dandy that AT&amp;T and Verizon have been charging them $1,200 over 2 years for that "$200" iPhone.<br /><br />We'll see what Verizon and AT&amp;T think of having their own recently-announced attempt to compete with T-Mobile's "un-carrier" position turned against them. &nbsp;I bet they won't like it but there isn't anything they can do about it either since we will use&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">facts</span></strong>&nbsp;in our marketing, never mind the bonus add-on that Virgin and Boost along with all the other MVNOs will immediately get access to the handsets as well.<br /><br />If the carriers who have been playing this game think they hate us wait until they see what their customers think of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">them</span>.</strong><br /><br /></li><li>I hire a group of 20 programmers -- all <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">aces</span></strong>. &nbsp;Their task? &nbsp;Two-fold, and it's a million bucks <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">each</span></strong>&nbsp;for them if they pull off the job which consists of:<ul><li>Porting&nbsp;<em>LibreOffice</em>&nbsp;to BB10.</li><li>Decoupling the HDMI resolution from the screen resolution so the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">full</span></strong>&nbsp;resolution of an HDMI-connected display is available.<br /><br />I give them 30 days to show me a working device and 60 for releasable code. &nbsp;Two months, a million bucks each. &nbsp;Hell of a deal. &nbsp;By doing these two things I now have (1) a dockable <strong><em>tablet replacement</em></strong>&nbsp;(BB10 already handles Bluetooth keyboards and mice) and (2) wide-screen capability. &nbsp;Coupled with the existing secure remote file access&nbsp;I now have the first-on-market&nbsp;<strong><em>and very functional</em></strong>&nbsp;part of a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">full</span></strong>&nbsp;mobile device strategy. &nbsp;Apple will <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span></strong>&nbsp;do this because it will destroy their tablet market, and for the same reason the Android phone makers won't do it either. &nbsp;This is what the "Linuxphone" people wanted to build and I'm going to do it first.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now</span></strong>&nbsp;I have the only <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">secure</span></strong>&nbsp;way to extend the corporate network anywhere with a device that does what the common worker's laptop or desktop machine does <strong><em>and has access</em></strong>&nbsp;to all of the corporate network, fits in your pocket, has an inexpensive, thin and small screen, keyboard and mouse available <strong><em>if you want one</em></strong>&nbsp;in your briefcase<strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">and which is secure</span></strong>&nbsp;at the same time.<br /><br /><strong>BlackBerry can own this market in a couple of months at minimal cost.<em><br />&nbsp;</em></strong></li></ul></li><li>The next step is to come up with a relatively-inexpensive WiFi -&gt; HDMI box that will plug into any HDMI-capable device and feed both video and audio. &nbsp;Write the companion driver and release the specs on the receiver side. &nbsp;<strong><em>Now I have wireless video for when you don't want to use a cable.</em></strong>&nbsp; Can I get there on WiFi that's in the existing devices? &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;1920x1080 is 2 million pixels. &nbsp;I have ~65Mbps on 802.11n without MIMO. &nbsp;With modest compression this works handily (it also comports reasonably well with BlueRay video that has bitrates in the ~40Mbps area, incidentally, which is another potential market use for this device -- and a reason for companies to embed it in their displays.) &nbsp;Target this for release within six months. &nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Very</span></strong>&nbsp;achievable and not very expensive.</li></ul><p>Might this strategy fail? &nbsp;Sure.</p><p>But I'm very sure there are 100 million customers out there who give a damn about security, and I'm willing to bet I can market to them and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">own</span></strong>&nbsp;them, where the other guys cannot. &nbsp;And that part of the strategy has <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">zero cost</span></strong>&nbsp;to the company, or damn close to it.</p><p>Further, that 100 million customers make the company not only viable but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">extremely</span></strong>&nbsp;profitable -- and that's before I destroy the "tablet" craze and own that segment of the market too.</p><p>Come and get it BlackBerry.</p>

If he&rsquo;d like to now claim that he did do the work required of him, then he has to admit that he lied to the public.</p><p>Given the choice between admitting negligence and lying, Dimon chose negligence.

  <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-24/young-invincibles-caught-in-crossfire-over-obamacare-cost.html" target="_blank">Oh look what the cat dragged in....</a></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;This population doesn&rsquo;t understand why insurance is necessary,&rdquo; Cheryl Smith, a health-exchange specialist at Deloitte Consulting LLP in New York, said in an interview. &ldquo;It really is to protect your assets. When you&rsquo;re young, you don&rsquo;t have assets. You don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>That's right.</p><p>When you're young and don't have assets <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you don't need much if any insurance</span></strong>. &nbsp;If something really awful happens you file bankruptcy instead, as you have nothing to lose.</p><p>This is why you carry minimum liability coverage on your car, and nothing else. &nbsp;You have <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">nothing to lose</span></strong>. &nbsp;In a serious accident where you get tagged for $1m you file bankruptcy. &nbsp;It makes <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">much more sense</span></strong>&nbsp;to cover only routine things (which you can afford) instead of the <strong><em>six sigma</em></strong>&nbsp;events that are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">extremely</span></strong>&nbsp;unlikely.</p><p>The latter, if it happens, has an "out" -- you have no assets, so you head to the courthouse and file bankruptcy. &nbsp;This is not not only legal <strong><em>it's entirely logical</em></strong>.</p><p>Note that if you're a bit older <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and also have no assets</span></strong>&nbsp;the same calculation attaches. &nbsp;You have nothing, therefore you need little protection of assets <strong><em>because you don't have any.</em></strong></p><p>There is this insane proposition among those in Washington that is the same as the insane proposition among so-called "investment professionals" that I see on display all the time. &nbsp;I witnessed some of it recently among a group that were nearly-all in the "1%" (if not all) when one of the presenters asked "<em>who in the room hasn't refinanced their house twice during the interest rate drop.</em>"</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One hand went up</span></strong>.</p><p>Why?&nbsp;</p><p>Because most of the rest of us either had no mortgage at all <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or a very small one</span></strong>&nbsp;compared to equity and the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cost</span></strong>&nbsp;of refinancing would not be recovered by the lower payments. &nbsp;In other words <strong><em>we didn't turn the crank in that fashion because it made no economic sense.</em></strong></p><p>The problem of course is that for the common man -- the "99%" -- the premise that the "health insurers" are trying to sell the population on is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">false</span></strong>.</p><p>As insurance costs rise <strong><em>the six-sigma event that puts you in the poor house becomes less economically interesting in insuring against</em></strong>.</p><p>At its core the "health insurance" mess is function of market manipulation through price-fixing and other forms of cartel behavior <strong>that are supposed to be illegal in the United States.</strong>&nbsp; But neither the left or right will take this on and the American Sheeple have been cowed into the corner and are unwilling to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">force</span></strong>&nbsp;a resolution through the political process.&nbsp;</p><p>The truth of the matter is that the entire medical establishment has become a cancer on the American economy and is consuming its host, resulting in an economic wasting disease that is emaciating everyone -- and everything -- in the American economy.</p><p><strong>This cancer must be excised and destroyed</strong>&nbsp;or our economy will die. &nbsp;Attempting to find ways to build more <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">arteries</span></strong>&nbsp;to carry <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">yet more blood and nourishment</span></strong>&nbsp;to it is an <strong><em>idiotic</em></strong>&nbsp;response to discovering cancer. &nbsp;You don't encourage the body to build circulatory resources to feed a cancer, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you kill it</span></strong>, either by cutting it out and tossing it in the trash or bombarding it with high levels of energy and various poisons (e.g. radiation and chemo.)</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>That</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;is the choice that was facing our nation two decades ago, a decade ago, in 2009 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and now</span>. &nbsp;But as with cancer <em>there is a window during which you can excise that growth</em>&nbsp;or it's too late <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and you die</span></strong><em>.</em></p><p><strong>We are rapidly reaching that economic point.</strong></p>

  <p>FLASH: Letter of intent on the table from FairFax.</p><p>Deal size ~$5 billion.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update</span>:</strong></p><p>There is a go-shop on the transaction; expect there to be some activity.</p><p>Prem Watsa clearly was looking for a scalp, and he got one with yesterday's dump. &nbsp;Guess who was buying while you were selling? &nbsp;Uh huh. &nbsp;That volume was huge and I bet he's got himself a nice chunk there, or at least some of the consortium does. &nbsp;<strong><em>Anything dirty about that -- and last week's announcement? &nbsp;Naw.....</em></strong></p><p>Presuming the reopen does not jump well over the $9 price you now have a buy here, as there's a floor on the price, assuming the deal goes -- and Prem knows the balance sheet and the business better than anyone, as until a few weeks ago he was a board member. &nbsp;You thus have to presume the diligence is in the bag, absent outright and intentional fraud in the accounting department.</p><p>For <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the business</span></strong>&nbsp;this is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">good</span></strong>. &nbsp;It means the firm goes out of the public eye and can focus without all the games. &nbsp;I suspect this unlocks Morgan Stanley's hesitance to upgrade, as just one example.</p><p>For the shareholders, well, not so good. &nbsp;If you're short and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">didn't</span></strong>&nbsp;cover it this morning (as I pointed out you damn well should have) you're going to give back 75 cents/share on the unlock, I assume, and maybe more. &nbsp;Oh well; if you were short from $11+ you're still happy I hope, and if you were short for years you ought to be quite happy. &nbsp;If over the last year it depends on what you paid to hold the short since it's been on the HTB list and thus had carrying costs that might have been fairly substantial. &nbsp;We'll see.</p><p>The danger for anyone who's short that sits at $9 and figures that's what it will be is that there's a month or so of go-shop now and surprises are likely to be on the upside. &nbsp;If you didn't cover it this morning I'd be doing it now.</p><p>If you want a spec play here the options for November, <strong><em>depending on the price</em></strong>&nbsp;when the unlock comes, might be interesting. &nbsp;The problem is that one must assume the option <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">writers</span></strong>&nbsp;are right about the risk and thus are unlikely to be giving money away, which means the premiums are likely to be fairly hefty right up until either a bid comes or nothing happens.</p>

<div>
Dr. Lindsey, who joined the CDC in 1999, is currently the deputy director for the Laboratory Science Policy and Practice Program Office. She’s second in command of the program office.</div>
<div>
Prior to that role, she was the senior health scientist in the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response, an office that oversees the allocation process for $1.5 billion in terrorism preparedness.</div>

<div>
Dr. Kimberly Quinlan Lindsey has been with the Centers for Disease Control for 12 years.<br />
“</div>
<div>
<strong>Atlanta (CNN)</strong> – An official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been arrested and charged with two counts of child molestation and one count of bestiality, police said.<br />
Police arrested Dr. Kimberly Quinlan Lindsey, 44, in DeKalb Count</div>
<div>y, Georgia, on Sunday.</div>
<div>
Authorities also charged Lindsey’s live-in boyfriend, Thomas Joseph Westerman, 42, with two counts of child molestation.<br />
The two are accused of “immoral and indecent” sexual acts involving a 6-year-old, according to information from DeKalb County Magistrate Court and an arrest warrant.</div>
<div>
The bestiality charge says Lindsey “did unlawfully perform or submit to any sexual act with an animal.”<br />
The alleged incidents took place between January 1, 2010, and August 22, 2011.</div>
<div>
Westerman is out of jail on bail; Lindsey remains in jail with bail set at $20,000, said Lt. Pam Kunz of the DeKalb County Police Department.</div>

<div>
Thomas Joseph Westerman, Lindsey’s live-in boyfriend, was arrested for counts of child molestation.</div>
<div>
Neither has made a public statement. Westerman did not immediately return a call from CNN.</div>
<div>
Both went to court on Sunday for an initial appearance and have a preliminary hearing scheduled for December 1, said Reggie Silverman, deputy clerk with DeKalb Magistrate Court.</div>
<div>
Lindsey is the deputy director for the Laboratory Science Policy and Practice Program Office at the CDC, according to her biography on the agency’s website.</div>
<div>
Prior to her current role, Lindsey was the senior health scientist in the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response. That office oversees the allocation process for $1.5 billion in terrorism preparedness.</div>
<div>
In her 12 years at the CDC, Lindsey has received 12 awards for outstanding performance on projects and programs, according to her bio on Emory University’s Biological and Biomedical Sciences website. Lindsey earned her doctorate in immunology and molecular pathogenesis from the university in 1998, a year before she began work at the CDC.</div>
<div>
A LinkedIn Web page for a Thomas Westerman lists him as having been a watch officer at the CDC from November 2009 to November 2010 and a resource management specialist since August 2011.</div>
<div>
CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said the agency is aware of the case but cannot comment on personnel issues.<br />
Dr. Lindsey Played Primary Role in Bogus Swine Flu Propaganda Campaign</div>
<div>
As you may recall, the <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/12/05/Swine-Flu-Shot-Side-Effects-Beginning-to-Take-Their-Toll.aspx">2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic</a> turned out to be a complete sham, with a fast-tracked and particularly dangerous vaccine being pushed as the sole remedy. Children and pregnant women were the primary targets of this dangerous vaccine. The H1N1 flu was a perfect example of how the CDC can brazenly distort reality, and often ignore and deny the dangerous and life-threatening side effects of their solution. As a result of this bogus propaganda campaign, thousands of people were harmed (and many died) worldwide.</div>
<div>
In August, it was revealed that the 2009 H1N1 influenza <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/08/06/vaccine-increases-narcolepsy-by-660-percent.aspx">vaccine increased the risk for narcolepsy</a>—a very rare and devastating sleeping disorder—in Swedish children and adolescents by 660 percent.</div>
<div>
Finland also noticed a dramatic increase in narcolepsy following vaccination with Pandemrix. There, <a href="http://www.thl.fi/thl-client/pdfs/dce182fb-651e-48a1-b018-3f774d6d1875">an interim report issued in January of this year</a> found that the H1N1 vaccine increased the risk of narcolepsy by 900 percent in children and adolescents below the age of 19. In the US, the H1N1 flu vaccine was statistically linked with abnormally high rates of miscarriage and stillbirths. As <a href="http://medalerts.org/analysis/archives/263">reported by Steven Rubin on the NVIC’s blog</a>, the US H1N1 flu vaccine was SIXTY timesmore likely to be reported to VAERS to be associated with miscarriage than previous seasonal flu vaccines.</div>
<div>
The only “winners” in this game were the pharmaceutical companies that received millions of dollars for this never-proven-effective and highly reactive vaccine, while being sheltered by our government from liability for any harm it caused.</div>
<div>
Dr. Lindsey played an important role in that campaign, which ended in tragedy for countless many—not from a killer flu (statistically, the 2009 H1N1 flu was MILDER than usual) but from the dangerous and expensive “remedy” to this oversold non-threat.</div>
<div>
All of that said, I do want to stress that Dr. Lindsey has not yet been found guilty, and there are still many unanswered questions relating to this case. But this is not the only shocking story raising questions about the ethics of those involved in creating the CDC’s health recommendations.<br />
The CDC’s Stance on Water Fluoridation—Another Misleading Recommendation<br />
Take water fluoridation for example.</div>
<div>
Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that since the 1970′s, the dental health professionals in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have had sole control over the agency’s stance supporting water fluoridation.</div>
<div>
The CDC is part of a larger <a href="http://cdc.gov/about/organization/cio.htm">administrative structure that provides intra-agency support</a> and resource sharing for health issues that require the input from more than one area of expertise. Other offices that share information and expertise with the CDC include the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office of Minority Health and Health Equity, and the Agency for Toxic Substances. The general assumption has been that the agency used a broad range of expert input to evaluate fluoride before reaching the decision to support water fluoridation.</div>
<div>
After all, since fluoride is swallowed, it stands to reason it may have an impact on your whole body, not just your teeth.<br />
Yet the documents show that no CDC toxicologists, minority health professionals, experts in diabetes, or others outside the Oral Health Division had any input into the agency’s position.</div>
<div>
This flies in the face of what the agency claims, and what water-, health- and political leaders have believed about the way the CDC operates. Without these additional experts from other fields, can we reasonably believe that the agency has properly assessed the research on whole-body harm from fluoridation? The documents have drawn attention once again to the CDC’s and EPA’s fluoride safety statements, which appear completely at odds with current scientific knowledge, and the fact that no outside experts from related fields were ever included may very well explain this discrepancy.</div>
<div>
CDC Doctor who “Debunked” Vaccine-Autism Link Indicted on Fraud</div>
<div>
Another shocking case involving the CDC is that of Dr. Poul Thorsen, who, after being found to have falsified documents, was indicted on fraud, money laundering and <a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/03/-danes-charge-cdc-linked-autism-researcher-thorsen-with-tax-eion.html">tax evasion</a> after stealing somewhere between $1-2 million in research grant money from the CDC.<br />
Here you might wonder why I’m faulting the CDC, as the organization was the victim of fraud. The reason I fault them is because they hired Dr. Thorsen to debunk the link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism—which he did to their satisfaction. However, CDC officials may have played a significant role in “guiding” this research to their desired end, and now that Thorsen has been exposed as a fraud, the agency still upholds his research as being of high caliber.</div>
<div>
As explained in a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr/central-figure-in-cdc-vac_b_494303.html">2010 article by Robert F. Kennedy Jr</a>.:</div>
<div>
“Thorsen was a leading member of a Danish research group that wrote several key studies supporting CDC’s claims that the MMR vaccine and mercury-laden vaccines were safe for children. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12949291">Thorsen’s 2003 Danish study</a> reported a 20-fold increase in autism in Denmark after that country banned mercury based preservatives in its vaccines. His study concluded that mercury could therefore not be the culprit behind the autism epidemic.</div>
<div>
His study has long been criticized as fraudulent since it failed to disclose that the increase was an artifact of new mandates requiring, for the first time, that autism cases be reported on the national registry. This new law and the opening of a clinic dedicated to autism treatment in Copenhagen accounted for the sudden rise in reported cases rather than, as Thorsen seemed to suggest, the removal of mercury from vaccines.<br />
Despite this obvious chicanery, CDC has long touted the study as the principal proof that mercury-laced vaccines are safe for infants and young children. Mainstream media, particularly the New York Times, has relied on this study as the basis for its public assurances that it is safe to inject young children with mercury — a potent neurotoxin — at concentrations hundreds of times over the U.S. safety limits.”<br />
Were CDC Officials in on the Fraud?</div>
<div>
<a href="http://www.putchildrenfirst.org/chapter5.html">Emails released in response to FOIA filings by parents</a> also show that Kreesten Madsen, one of Dr. Thorsen’s research partners, had acquiesced to the wishes of CDC officials who wanted to cherry pick facts in order to prove vaccine safety. Furthermore, according to an April 28 <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/032216_Thorsen_fraud.html">report by Natural News</a>:</div>
<div>
“From February 2004 through June 2008, says the DOJ indictment, Thorsen allegedly submitted over a dozen fraudulent invoices requesting reimbursement for expenses that were fabricated. Interestingly, these allegedly fraudulent invoices were <strong>signed by a laboratory section chief at the CDC</strong>, indicating that someone inside the CDC was either duped by Thorsen or potentially involved in the alleged fraud.<br />
… This is the great untold story of <strong>an alleged criminal ring operating inside the CDC</strong>, with the purpose of falsifying research that would “disprove” any links between vaccines and toxic side effects.”</div>
<div>
<strong>Why Does the CDC Not Invalidate Dr. Thorsen’s Research?</strong></div>
<div>
Dr. Thorsen’s studies are frequently quoted in rebuttals to the claim that vaccines may play a role in the disorder. <a href="http://www.taap.info/DanishStudy2005.pdf">The studies in question were riddled with flaws</a>, yet despite the fact that Thorsen’s studies may actually be a complete sham, the CDC has not officially declared them invalid. In fact, they’re still <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/articles.html">listed on the CDC website</a> as part of the scientific backing of their stance on autism and vaccine safety.<br />
Nor has the media jumped on this story and exposed how vaccine-safety claims have been based on junk science by a scam artist. They’ve also failed to question why none of the journals have denounced Dr. Thorsen’s studies, which support the claim that vaccines are safe, while Dr. Wakefield’s research was denounced after the mere insinuation of wrong-doing.<br />
Furthermore, according to <a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/03/poul-thorsens-mutating-resume.html">research by Dan Olmsted and Mark Blaxill writing for AgeOfAutism.com</a>, Dr. <a href="http://www.rescuepost.com/files/thorsen---disclosure---1-22-10.pdf">Thorsen has also been working with the American Psychiatric Association</a> (APA) on an updated definition of “autism” for the <a href="http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Default.aspx">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)</a>, which is slated for release in May 2013. I believe it would be prudent to take a deeper look at his input, to make sure his connections to the CDC and his role in protecting vaccine safety has not tainted the new definition of autism.<br />
The sad fact is that conflicts of interest color most of the ties between our government and the pharmaceutical industry, and conventional media repeatedly fails to report the truth on these matters.<br />
So, who can you trust?</p>

<blockquote>Despite all the hand-wringing heard in DC, a short-term government shut down (which doesn’t actually shut down the government) will not cause the country to collapse.

And the American people would benefit if Obamacare was defeated or even delayed.

As heartened as we should be by the fight against Obamacare, we should be equally disheartened by the fact that so few in DC are talking about making real cuts in federal spending. Even fewer are talking about reductions in the most logical place to reduce spending: the military-industrial complex.  The US military budget constitutes almost 50 percent of the total worldwide military spending.  Yet to listen to some in Congress, one would think that America was one canceled multi-million dollar helicopter contract away from being left totally defenseless. - <a href="http://the-free-foundation.org/tst9-30-2013.html" target="_blank">Ron Paul, Texas Straight Talk</a></blockquote>
Americans are tired of constant war, as evidenced recently when over 90% of those polled rejected our need to go into Syria, and extend our military into places that are of no strategic threat to national security.  Additionally, with the American people already experiencing a year of pre-implementation for Obamacare through increased taxes and employer based mandates, the results have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the promises made by President Obama and the Democratically led Congress of 2009 were nothing more than falsehoods meant to place the public under a socialistic form of health rationing and control.

The government is completely broke, and has no intention of cutting spending, and does not ever want to halt the increase of a government bureaucracy that is becoming more militarized and more intrusive in every facet of our lives.  Yet like the old saying in some religious beliefs, sometimes one must be allowed to go into the gutter before they will wake up, accept the fact that what they have been doing is wrong, and reach up to a higher power to help pull them out of their misery.

Doing the same things over and over is one definition of insanity, yet despite the results, Congress and the White House continue to borrow money, and increase spending for programs that are detrimental to the best interests of the American people.  And like Ron Paul assesses in his weekly straight talk, it might be time to let the shutdown occur, and force the divided Congress to actually make meaningful changes to their programs and spending, for the consequences of not doing so are much worse than the cure.

<blockquote>Moving to the US it now appears almost certain, according to DB’s Frank Kelly, that the US government will shut down at midnight tonight (September 30th) for the first time since 1996 after the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a continuing resolution early Sunday morning which would fund the government through to December 15th but included an amendment to delay Obamacare by one year and repeal a related tax on medical devices. The bill is now with the Democrat-controlled Senate where majority Leader Harry Reid has already stated the bill is unacceptable. As we write the Senate is not even set to come back into session until 2p.m. Monday afternoon leaving Congress just hours to avoid a shutdown. If no agreement is reached the federal government will shut down all nonessential operations on October 1st which will stay shut down until a new law is agreed by Congress and signed by the President. Frank’s current view is that a shutdown will not last too long and he has a baseline figure of around 2-5 days, with a lot depending on the public reaction to the shutdown. - <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-09-30/futures-tumbles-ahead-us-government-shutdown" target="_blank">Zerohedge</a></blockquote>
Back in 1996, the Republican led House of Representatives lost a showdown with President Clinton over a government stoppage due in part to the arrogance of then Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich.  The American people overwhelmingly gave their support to the President during this crisis, and the House was forced to back down.  Ironically, after the crisis President Clinton began a more moderate stance on the economy, and for the rest of his term was able to work with the House to achieve many forms of consensus.

In 2013 however, both Congress, and the nation are much more divided, and consensus appears to be an impossibility due to overwhelming ideological differences.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has stated, and proven through the first round of voting that the Democrats will not listen to the American people, nor will they talk about compromise despite the enormous amount of evidence showing that Obamacare is causing a fundamental shift in the arena of jobs for most Americans.  Since the beginning of 2013, around 80% of all jobs created are part time, or entail a 30 hour or less work week as companies realize Obamacare is a nail in the coffin of economic growth.

If there ever was a time for the Republicans to stand strong, and allow a government shutdown, it is at this time in history.  Since no appropriation bills have been passed leading up to the new fiscal year at midnight tonight, and fresh off the public's rejection of Obama's warmongering in Syria, public opinion appears to be on the side of the Conservatives unlike in 1996.  And as evidenced by the market just 18 hours before the clock strikes midnight, even Wall Street now agrees that a shutdown is inevitable as noted in the negative futures prices well before the opening bell.

Frank’s current view is that a shutdown will not last too long and he has a baseline figure of around 2-5 days, with a lot depending on the public reaction to the shutdown. - <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-09-30/futures-tumbles-ahead-us-government-shutdown" target="_blank">Zerohedge</a></blockquote>
Back in 1996, the Republican led House of Representatives lost a showdown with President Clinton over a government stoppage due in part to the arrogance of then Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich.  The American people overwhelmingly gave their support to the President during this crisis, and the House was forced to back down.  Ironically, after the crisis President Clinton began a more moderate stance on the economy, and for the rest of his term was able to work with the House to achieve many forms of consensus.

In 2013 however, both Congress, and the nation are much more divided, and consensus appears to be an impossibility due to overwhelming ideological differences.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has stated, and proven through the first round of voting that the Democrats will not listen to the American people, nor will they talk about compromise despite the enormous amount of evidence showing that Obamacare is causing a fundamental shift in the arena of jobs for most Americans.  Since the beginning of 2013, around 80% of all jobs created are part time, or entail a 30 hour or less work week as companies realize Obamacare is a nail in the coffin of economic growth.

If there ever was a time for the Republicans to stand strong, and allow a government shutdown, it is at this time in history.  Since no appropriation bills have been passed leading up to the new fiscal year at midnight tonight, and fresh off the public's rejection of Obama's warmongering in Syria, public opinion appears to be on the side of the Conservatives unlike in 1996.  And as evidenced by the market just 18 hours before the clock strikes midnight, even Wall Street now agrees that a shutdown is inevitable as noted in the negative futures prices well before the opening bell.

<p>ABC is reporting that it is now almost certain Congress and the White House will not reach an agreement to avoid a government shutdown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Sunday’s <em>This Week</em>, ABC’s chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl said, “I would now put the chances of a government shutdown at 99.9 percent” (video follows with transcript and commentary):</p>
<p><iframe title="MRC TV video player" width="640" height="360" src="http://www.mrctv.org/embed/123057" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<blockquote><p>GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Jon, hard to say how long it will last, but this makes some kind of shutdown late tomorrow all but certain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JONATHAN KARL: Oh, that’s right, George. Positions have hardened. Time is running out. I would now put the chances of a government shutdown at 99.9 percent. It was after midnight in a raucous session last night that the House did what they did. The bill, what it would actually do, would fund the government until December, it would delay ObamaCare for one year, and it would repeal a tax on medical devices that’s part of the healthcare law. They also separately passed a provision that would fund the troops regardless of a government shutdown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The White House response was swift, George, to Jay Carney saying, “Today Republicans in the House of Representatives moved to shut down the government.” And it&#8217;s hard to disagree with that because the Senate absolutely will not pass what just passed in the House. And George, the Senate doesn&#8217;t get back into session until 2:00 tomorrow afternoon. That is ten hours before the government shuts down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://newsbusters.org/sites/default/files/main_photos/2013/September/Karl%20929.jpg?1380470075" />GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, HOST: So, they send their bill right back to the House. What happens next?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KARL: Well, unclear, but what I am hearing this morning from Republicans is that they will still attempt to put provisions in there dealing with the healthcare law and send it back to the Senate. This ping pong back and forth will go on. No signs of compromise on either side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEPHANOPOULOS: And then the question is how long will that go, a couple of days, or does it stretch on maybe up to the point where we reach that second major deadline, the debt limit reach on October 17? Far more serious, but does this back and forth make it more likely that we&#8217;ll avoid a confrontation over the debt limit?</p></blockquote>

<p>Top professor warns ’all of humanity will be threatened for thousands of years’ if Fukushima is not stopped, and it may soon get much worse</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Gucciardi</strong><br />
Infowars.com<br />
September 29, 2013</p>
<p>A Yale professor is cautioning the world to wake up from its nuclear slumber and face the severity of the Fukushima radiation crisis, <a href="http://enenews.com/yale-professor-fukushima-unit-4-pool-in-perilous-condition-all-of-humanity-will-be-threatened-for-thousands-of-years-if-not-able-to-be-kept-cool-danger-of-it-collapsing-in-storm-or-during-a" target="_blank">warning that</a> ’all of humanity will be threatened for thousands of years’ if the Fukushima unit 4 pool is not kept cool. The disturbing statements act as a voice of reality when it comes to the depth of the Fukushima disaster, an event that world governments have relentlessly attempted to downplay while silently shutting down radiation counters and raising ‘acceptable’ levels of radiation in the food supply.</p>
<p><img alt="fukushima-explosion" src="http://static.infowars.com/bindnfocom/2013/09/fukushima-explosion.jpg" width="400" height="234" /></p>
<p>The Fukushima explosion that officials now admit led to the emission of more than double the radiation levels originally stated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, along with other nuclear physicists and scientists, Professor Charles Perrow of Yale is sounding the alarm on the disaster that myself and others have been warning against since day one. And another prominent intellectual now speaking out on the subject does not surprise me. After all, we are seeing more and more high level academics speaking out due to the overall understanding that even job loss is nothing compared to the fatal consequences of allowing Fukushima to meltdown indefinitely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his article posted on the Huffington Post website, Professor Charles Perrow <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-perrow/fukushima-forever_b_3941589.html">cautions</a>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Conditions in the unit 4 pool, 100 feet from the ground, are perilous, and if any two of the rods touch it could cause a nuclear reaction that would be uncontrollable. The radiation emitted from all these rods, if they are not continually cool and kept separate, would require the evacuation of surrounding areas including Tokyo. Because of the radiation at the site the 6,375 rods in the common storage pool could not be continuously cooled; <strong>they would fission and all of humanity will be threatened, for thousands of years</strong>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Professor’s statements coincide with the warnings of previous experts who have said that Fukushima trumps even Chernobyl and other nuclear disasters. Even the mainstream media has covered these declarations as Japanese studies expose the fact that radiation levels emitted from Fukushima <a href="http://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/11/28319/2011/acpd-11-28319-2011.html" target="_blank">were much higher</a> than plant officials ever admitted (and it was predominantly dumped into the Pacific Ocean). The Independent <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/why-the-fukushima-disaster-is-worse-than-chernobyl-2345542.html" target="_blank">reports</a>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Some scientists say Fukushima is worse than the 1986 Chernobyl accident, with which it shares a maximum level-7 rating on the sliding scale of nuclear disasters.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the true problem lies with the aforementioned spent fuel rods. All the boron between the spent fuel rods has disintegrated, and plant officials are gearing up to remove them within the next couple of months. What the Yale Professor and others are warning about really comes down to the fact that a chain nuclear reaction could begin in the event that the rods get too close together. This, they say, would create nuclear mayhem. And given the <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/fukushima-radiation-levels-two-times-amount-claimed/">record of the plant</a> operators, who at one point were using duct tape and trash to fill in the destructing plant, this task is truly concerning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By spreading the word on the issue, we can ignite worldwide awakening on the severity of Fukushima’s radioactive nightmare and demand immediate action. For now, it is essential to prepare yourself and your family. Recently, radiation expert Dr. Edward F. Group discussed the power of nascent ‘nuclear’ iodine and his ideas to better prepare your family:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—————————</p>
<h1><strong>Nuclear Iodine: Doctor Reveals Fukushima Radiation Nightmare Solution</strong></h1>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NC8YslJ6PNQ" height="480" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Fukushima radiation nightmare continues, top experts and analysts are continuing to warn against the devastating radiological effects that are already hammering citizens of the Northern Hemisphere and around the globe at record levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while Fukushima is considered to be ‘even worse’ by nuclear scientists and <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/video/asia-pacific/2011/09/201191845015428149.html">researchers than</a>Chernobyl in terms of the radioactive contamination, what’s even more concerning is the fact that Fukushima is only one factor in the spiking levels of radiation within the United States and abroad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past several decades we have seen the emergence of excessive nuclear testing, the voluminous creation of nuclear power facilities, medical applications with radiation, the pollution of the air with radioactive elements, and even the absolute contamination of the food supply with health-crushing radiation — all contributing to a spike in background radiation levels that have been steadily climbing since just 60 years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, even the Fukushima plant operators were forced to admit that the radiation levels released from the plant explosion were at the very least 2 1/2 times greater than they admitted. But the real question is what happened to the majority of the radioactive contamination? According to one <a href="http://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/11/28319/2011/acpd-11-28319-2011.html">revealing study</a> examining the true crippling effects of Fukushima on the globe, 20% of the caesium-137 fell on Japanese land, and about 2% ended up on land outside the country. The remainder came down in the Pacific Ocean, which means around 68% of the highly dangerous radioactive waste was released directly into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it any wonder now that the EPA <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/031963_radiation_exposure.html">is actually</a> going ahead and raising the ‘acceptable levels’ of radiation in the food supply as other nations just blatantly shut off their radiation tracking systems? Radioactive isotopes have already been discovered in California, and even as far away as Boston. There’s a reason that even the Huffington Post <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-perrow/fukushima-forever_b_3941589.html">now says</a> that we are facing ‘Fukushima Forever’ as radiation continues to drain into the ocean.</p>

<p>Whether or not the microchip requirement in the bill is implemented by 2013, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2010, my book “Are You Ready for the Microchip?” was released, and I asked the question, “Is the microchip implant hidden in the Healthcare Bill? Are newborn children starting in 2013 going to receive a microchip shortly after birth?” Then in the book, I wrote, “ In the massive US HEALTHCARE BILL, which your elected representatives voted for without reading, there is a section titled: Subtitle C-11 Sec. 2521 – National Medical Device Registry which states:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ObA3OIo8_94" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“The Secretary shall establish a national medical device registry (in this subsection referred to as the ‘registry’) to facilitate analysis of postmarket safety and outcomes data on each device that—‘‘(A) is or has been used in or on a patient; and ‘‘(B) is a class III device; or ‘‘(ii) a class II device that is implantable.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em></em>The language is deliberately vague, but it provides the structure for making America the first nation in the world that would require every U.S. citizen to receive an implanted radio-frequency (RFID) microchip for the purpose of controlling medical care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of states like Virginia, have passed “stop the mark of the beast legislation” in an effort to stop this kind of legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with numerous other things that I have written and spoken about based on solid documentation, I am regularly challenged by some, and especially those in the Christian community, who are clueless about what is going on. Their criticism has never prevented me from presenting the facts, because I never take a poll about what I write or speak on. A Christian is called to speak the truth in love, whether or not it is accepted. I am not trying to disparage any ministry, but I don’t determine what I say based on whether or not it is “seeker friendly,” or popular. The only issue is, is it true and is it wise to communicate it at that particular time?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many things that I could say, but don’t, because there many people in our nation who, when confronted with a truth that is outside the box of their socially engineered consciousness, go into cognitive dissonance. As the microchip implant moves closer day by day, along with the “manufactured crisis” of illegal immigration, the problems of states like Arizona are creating an environment where Senators Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) are moving legislation forward that would require all U.S. workers, citizens and resident alike, to obtain and carry a National Biometric ID Card in order to work within the United States. It does not matter where you stand on the issue of amnesty or immigration, everyone is going to have to have a National Biometric ID Card that will eventually contain an RFID transmitter which will allow Big Brother electronic data bases to track all of your personal information. It is a simply a national ID card under another name. The national ID card will transition into a microchip implant, because that is technically more efficient. All of this which is about to happen very soon, is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Ronald Reagan refused to pass what he called this “Mark of the Beast” legislation. In my book, “Are You Ready for the Microchip?,” I examine the careful wording in the Health Care Bill which calls for a Med-Chip and a microchip implant. It was never hidden, it is simply Republican and Democrat, along with our corporate-controlled and Orwellian media, who deliberately chose to ignore it. The Bilderberg Group gave orders to microchip the entire U.S. population and then the world. Before the Health Care Bill was passed, the target date was set for the year 2013, when every baby born in the U.S. will receive a microchip at birth. Many are attacking President Obama for this, but although it is the Obama Health Care Bill, the microchip plan was created decades ago and put onto the fast track by the Republican Administration of President George Bush and his allegedly “born-again” Attorney General, John Ashcroft, after 911. It seems Ashcroft was more concerned about covering up the breasts of a Lady Liberty statue in the hallway of the Department of Justice, than he was about protecting our Constitutional liberties, which include the freedom of religion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RFID Chip Implantation already being used today.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sKVj2V4-yPE" height="360" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Evangelical Christians make excellent political pawns because they focus on secondary issues, rather than the important issues. This is because Evangelical Christianity in America today does not have a truly Biblical worldview. I truly do not want to sound unkind, but the historical reality is that Evangelical Christians have played the part of what Lenin called “useful idiots.” Obviously, this is not what God planned for His people. But, by rejecting a Biblical worldview, the Scripture, “My people perish for lack of knowledge,” is fulfilled. The majority of Evangelical Christians in America have a very superficial faith as a result of what they are being taught in many of their churches and seminaries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.secretsofthefed.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2012-08-13-at-12.12.25-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-98676" alt="Screen-Shot-2012-08-13-at-12.12.25-AM" src="http://www.secretsofthefed.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2012-08-13-at-12.12.25-AM.png" width="486" height="543" /></a></p>
<p>Glass-encased RFID chips, ready for implantation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new microchip technology with an RFID chip is so advanced it sounds like science fiction. The Apostle Paul explains how this fits into Revelation 13, where the False Prophet will head a one world religion and force people to accept the mark of the beast. A microchip implant, biochip implant or med chip, in and of itself, is not necessarily the mark of the beast. The mark of the beast under the direction of the False Prophet, requires the conscious rejection of Jesus Christ as Lord and a commitment to worship the Antichrist as God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr3200ih/pdf/BILLS-111hr3200ih.pdf" target="_blank">If you still thinking this is a lie feel free to check out the H.R. 3200 PDF file </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr3200ih/pdf/BILLS-111hr3200ih.pdf" target="_blank">click on this link </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scroll down to page 1000,  the writing for the RFID chip starts half way on page 1000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge for Christians and others will be the very act of taking a microchip implant, biochip implant or med chip, simply because of its parallel to the Biblical mark of the beast. Will people of faith be exempted for religious reasons or will they be forced to take it or imprisoned. In addition, any microchip technology could be activated with enhanced controls after it is implanted. So what starts out as a simple microchip implant could become a technology where at some future time, you must worship the Antichrist as God, and reject Jesus Christ as Lord in order to participate in the economic system. The built-in and evolving capacity of microchip technology makes this a dangerous possibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rsbgqTCS9ZQ" height="480" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the simple act of accepting the implantation of a microchip for medical reasons appears harmless on the surface. However, there is no guarantee that once it is implanted, that it will not be activated for mark of the beast technology. This is the danger and challenge that lies before us.</p>

<p align="left">Former Governor Jesse Ventura and radio personality Howard Stern are set Wednesday on Stern’s radio show to discuss the serious possibility of a 2016 presidential run.</p>

<p align="left">
<p align="left">Talking on and off air to Alex Jones, Ventura made it clear this is very serious and not a stunt, and that the two are in real talks for a 2016 Ventura-Stern ticket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ventura will fly to New York this Wednesday to appear on Stern’s Sirius XM show, during which Ventura will formally request that Stern join him on the ticket.</p>
<p align="left">
<p align="left">Ventura told the Alex Jones Show that he is deadly serious about running for the White House with Stern as his VP. Due to Ventura’s refusal to entertain the notion of taking money from special interests, Stern, whose radio show brings in around $100 million a year, will be in charge of fundraising.</p>
<p align="left">
<p align="left">Although Ventura had to quit his radio show when he ran for Governor of Minnesota in order to comply with FCC regulations, Stern will not have to quit his current show because satellite radio is not subject to the same rules as terrestrial radio.</p>
<p align="left">
<p align="left">However, <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sirius-xm-ceo-committed-keeping-637323">Stern has indicated</a> he will probably quit his current show in 2015 anyway, leaving the path clear for a presidential campaign to begin the same year.</p>
<p align="left">
<p align="left">Off air, Ventura told Jones that Stern is one of the smartest people he knows and that his libertarian mindset make the two a perfect combination. It is likely that Ventura and Stern will attempt to secure the Libertarian Party nomination, which in 2012 was won by former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson.</p>
<p align="left">
<p align="left">Stern previously ran for Governor of New York as a libertarian candidate in 1994, promising to fix the roads and repeal the death penalty.</p>
<p align="left">
<p align="left">Ventura is about to commence a book tour but confirmed that he would run for president, with Stern as his VP, exclusively with the Alex Jones Show.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If this does happen, strap yourselves in,” says Alex. “This will be the biggest political shakeup since Ross Perot ran for president in 1992.”</p>
<p align="left">

<p>(NaturalNews) The curse of being a critical thinker is that you can&#8217;t turn it off, I&#8217;ve discovered. So you become a critical thinker about everything you&#8217;ve been told or taught, and as it turns out, most of what we&#8217;ve all been taught about genetics is a lie.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t take my word for it. Join me as we take an honest, critical look at genetics using the same kind of skepticism scientists demand we invoke when looking at medicinal herbs or acupuncture.</p>
<p>Genetics is an attempt by materialistic scientists to offer a purely materialist view of inheritance and development of not just physical bodies but non-physical inherited attributes such as instinctive behaviors and cellular function.</p>
<p>According to the theory of genetics, physical gene sequences contained in chromosomes found in each cell in your body are a &#8220;blueprint&#8221; for all your body&#8217;s physical structures, biochemical functions and inherited behavioral patterns. This blueprint, the theory goes, contains ALL the instructions needed to create a complete human form with all its physical structures, physiological functions and inherited behaviors fully represented and complete.</p>
<p>Because of the enormous complexity of the human body, organ function, cell structures and instinctive behaviors, it was once believed that humans must possess somewhere around 2 million protein-coding genes. The Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 with the widespread belief that when it was finished, it would &#8220;unlock&#8221; all the mysteries of the origins of disease in humans. It was also believed that when the <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/human.html">human</a> genome fully mapped, scientists would be able to create humans in any form they wanted, including humans with extra arms or legs, humans free of all disease, humans with &#8220;enhanced&#8221; physical powers, and so on.</p>
<p>At the start of the <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/Human_Genome_Project.html">Human Genome Project</a>, everybody &#8220;knew&#8221; that humans were far more complex than, say, a roundworm, which only has about 20,000 protein-coding genes. This is why estimates of the number of genes in a human ranged from 100,000 to 2 million. Scientists were absolutely sure that humans were far more complex than a tiny roundworm, and therefore humans needed far more genes.</p>
<h1>The Human Genome Project suffers an &#8220;epic fail&#8221;</h1>
<p>The first draft of the Human Genome Project was published in the year 2,000. Far from being a breakthrough that would end all human disease, its findings utterly shattered the mythology of genetics as the sole explanation for all inheritance and physical development. Why? Because the Human Genome Project found that humans have <b>only about 20,000 protein-coding <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/genes.html">genes</a></b>, roughly the same number as the roundworm.</p>
<p>Huh? A human being has about the same number of protein-coding genes as a roundworm? Yes. And that&#8217;s straight out of the mouths of human genome researchers who are, themselves, hard-core materialists.</p>
<p>By comparison, the common fruit fly has about 15,000 genes, only marginally less than a human. And yet it is obvious to any intelligent observer than a human being is considerably more complex than a fruit fly and a roundworm. So why didn&#8217;t the Human Genome Project find a lot more genes that code proteins in humans?</p>
<h1>Genetic inheritance theory shattered</h1>
<p>The findings of the multi-billion-dollar Human Genome Project shattered the mythology of genetic materialism, sending nearly the entire scientific community into a tailspin and forcing &#8220;the great genetic cover-up&#8221; to begin.</p>
<p>Human genes simply needed &#8220;more research&#8221; to be understood, scientists exclaimed. And since the year 2000, that research has continued to no avail. The cover-up continues&#8230;</p>
<p>The truth is that <b>there isn&#8217;t enough data storage in 20,000 genes to hold a blueprint for a human being</b>.</p>
<h1>Human DNA data storage capacity</h1>
<p>Allow me to explain this from a computer science point of view, as many of you know I founded a very successful computer software company and was the head of R&amp;D for many computer science projects, including the popular new <a href="http://science.naturalnews.com/">SCIENCE.naturalnews.com</a> which uses advanced statistical algorithms to analyze scientific concepts across millions of published studies.</p>
<p>The human genome contains about 3 billion &#8220;base pairs&#8221; of genes. Each base pair can exist in one of four possible combinations of the four bases that make up <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/DNA.html">DNA</a>: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G).</p>
<p>From a digital storage point of view &#8212; as DNA is &#8220;digital&#8221; in its format &#8212; a base pair is equivalent to two bits of binary data, which can represent four possible states as follows:</p>
<p>00<br />
01<br />
10<br />
11</p>
<p>In computer storage vernacular, a &#8220;byte&#8221; is eight bits of data, such as:</p>
<p>01011010</p>
<p>Four DNA base pairs, then, makes one byte of data.</p>
<p>Given that there are roughly 3 billion base pairs in the human genome, this equates to roughly about 750MB of data storage capacity.</p>
<p>It turns out this number is shockingly small. 750MB is smaller than the file of a typical modern video game. It&#8217;s smaller than a movie on a DVD, in fact. It&#8217;s so small that a typical miniature thumb drive you might buy at Best Buy can actually store over 20 times as much data (that&#8217;s merely a 16 GB thumb drive). You can buy a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Class-Flash-Memory-SDSDB-016G-AFFP/dp/B007JRB0SS">16GB SD card right now on Amazon.com</a> for a mere $12.</p>
<p>750MB of data is so small that no one can explain how it could possibly account for a human body with extraordinary complexity while somehow encompassing physical, structural, functional and behavioral inheritance as well.</p>
<p>To get a grasp of the complexity of the human body, realize that your body is made of 60 &#8211; 90 <i>trillion</i> cells. Each cell is its own ecosystem with highly complex functions including cell energy production, waste removal, cell membrane function, the nucleus command control center, and so on.</p>
<p>Your body manufactures 10 million red blood cells every hour. It has a capacity to heal damaged tissues almost everywhere. Your skin and intestines are being slowly replaced with new cells every minute. Your immune system is incredibly complex and highly capable, representing the most advanced system of nanotechnology that modern science has ever witnessed.</p>
<p>On top of all this, you are born with innate behaviors and the ability to develop, all on your own, the behavioral skills to walk, talk, focus your eyes, digest foods, eliminate waste, sweat, breathe and much more. Meanwhile, your body accomplishes <b>billions of chemical reactions every second</b> without you even knowing it. Somehow, every cell, organ and organ system in your body knows what to do to keep you alive and functioning.</p>
<p>Your body and its functions are unimaginably complex. Simply cataloging the structure and function of all the cells in your body right now would take countless <i>terabytes</i> of data &#8212; more than a million times larger than &#8220;megabytes&#8221; of data.</p>
<p>Yet the entire human genome delivers only 750MB worth of data storage. Obviously, this is wholly insufficient to describe the entire structure, function and development of a human being. No matter how the desperate materialists try to keep us focused on human genes, it flat-out isn&#8217;t possible to store a full blueprint of the human <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/form.html">form</a> in 750MB of data.</p>
<p>The human genome, therefore, <b>is not the entire blueprint of human development</b>. Although some genes do obviously code for some physical characteristics (such as eye color), genes alone do not contain the full blueprint. There must be something else that also contributes morphological information in addition to DNA.</p>
<p>The Human Genome Project, to the shock of nearly all materialists, ultimately proved exactly the opposite of what scientists had hoped. It proved that <b>genes alone do not explain inheritance</b>.</p>
<p>The materialists were horrified by this finding. To this very day, they are pouring over human genome data, desperately trying to find some &#8220;meta data&#8221; that would explain all inheritance. What they refuse to acknowledge is that there is a <b>non-physical field of inheritance patterns</b> that functions as an overlay to the human genome, interacting with it and enhancing its scope with non-physical encoding of additional information needed to develop a complete human form.</p>
<p>That field is called the &#8220;<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/morphic_resonance.html">morphic resonance</a>&#8221; field, and it was proposed by one of the most brilliant, revolutionary scientific thinkers of our time, Rupert Sheldrake, a biologist and author of &#8220;Science Set Free.&#8221;</p>
<h1>Morphic resonance fields infuriate materialists</h1>
<p>The idea of morphic resonance infuriates materialists &#8212; and nearly all modern-day scientists are materialists &#8212; because the presence of a non-physical field of information naturally leads to the most dangerous idea of all to materialist science: the idea of <i>consciousness</i>.</p>
<p>This idea that your body as a whole, as well as each cell in your body, can tap into a field of information which encodes the &#8220;memory&#8221; of what a human form is supposed to be threatens the very pillars of materialistic science, upon which nearly the entire pharmaceutical industry is based, by the way. This is why materialist scientists are desperately attempting to defend the human genome as the single source of all the information needed to develop a human body, even though the human genome clearly doesn&#8217;t have the storage capacity to represent an entire body (not to mention inherited physiological functions and behavioral inheritance).</p>
<p>The best place to read and learn about morphic resonance is at Rupert Sheldrake&#8217;s website:<br />
<a href="http://www.sheldrake.org/Articles&amp;Papers/papers/morphic/morphic_intro.html" target="_blank">http://www.sheldrake.org/Articles&amp;Papers/pap&#8230;</a></p>
<p>I also recommend his amazingly insightful book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Science-Life-Hypothesis-Resonance/dp/0892815353">A New Science of Life</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you read about Rupert Sheldrake from any materialistic science website &#8212; including <i>Scientific American</i> which is 100% pro-Monsanto, pro-GMO and anti GMO labeling, by the way &#8212; you are going to read vicious attacks against Sheldrake from desperate materialists who brand morphic resonance as &#8220;magical thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is especially comic, given that these same materialists believe the entire universe in which we live spontaneously appeared from nowhere <i>without cause or reason</i> through a process they call the &#8220;Big Bang.&#8221; Somehow, the big bang isn&#8217;t magical thinking to the materialists, but the idea of a non-physical field of inheritance is magical thinking. It&#8217;s almost like these people have never heard of gravity: yet another invisible field that affects all living things.</p>
<h1>How does your hand know it&#8217;s a hand?</h1>
<p>Another key problem with the theory of genetic inheritance is that even though all the cells across your body are supposed to contain the same exact genetic code, somehow the cells in your hand knew they were supposed to grow into a hand, not a foot or an ear, for example.</p>
<p>Conventional genetics has no explanation for this. How does a cell &#8220;know&#8221; it&#8217;s supposed to be a specialized cell functioning as a tiny part of the whole? If every blood cell in your body contains the DNA for your entire body, how does it &#8220;know&#8221; to form itself into a blood cells and not, for example, a skin cell?</p>
<p>Rupert Sheldrake&#8217;s morphic resonance explanation provides an answer. The cell taps into a knowledge field &#8212; a non-physical pattern blueprint &#8212; and through influence with that field, the cell knows to activate only the genes that code for it to form a blood cell. The local physical genes accomplish the protein coding, but the morphic resonance field directs the pattern of which genes to activate. This is how morphic fields interact with DNA.</p>
<p>The human genome, in other words, works hand in hand with a non-physical information field that keeps physical form development organized so that the resulting form is a human. The morphic resonance field &#8220;knows&#8221; the pattern of being human because it is a pattern that has been reinforced by billions of other humans who came before you and contributed to the resonance of the field.</p>
<p>This explains the <b>missing link in DNA</b> &#8211; the fact that DNA alone cannot store the entire blueprint of the human form. The master blueprint is actually found in the non-physical morphic field. Local DNA are simply &#8220;protein builders&#8221; that follow the morphic resonance blueprint.</p>
<p>Just like there is an energetic pattern for a human being, there&#8217;s also a different energetic template for an oak tree, and it overlays the genes from an oak tree seed, directing it to form a fully-grown oak tree. For every cell, every organ, every organ system and every life form on our planet (and across the universe), there is a morphic resonance field that provides the template overlay which affects local gene activation.</p>
<h1>Learn more about morphic resonance</h1>
<p>This article, of course, is only a short summary of the concept of morphic resonance. To learn more, I encourage you to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rupert-Sheldrake/e/B000AQ3F38">read books by Rupert Sheldrake</a>, and visit the <a href="http://www.sheldrake.org/homepage.html">Sheldrake.org website</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Sheldrake&#8217;s theories absolute infuriate materialist scientists. The journal Nature actually suggested that Sheldrake should be burned at the stake&#8230; like a witch, I suppose. <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/041931_TED_talks_censorship_consciousness.html">TED talks essentially banned Sheldrake from speaking</a> because he dared mention the idea of &#8220;consciousness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everywhere across the fatally closed-minded community of materialist science, Sheldrake is considered to be worse than a demon&#8230; he is a <i>non-believer</i> in the Church of Materialism! And there is no greater sin to today&#8217;s cult-like science community than non-belief in materialism.</p>
<p>This is why Sheldrake&#8217;s ideas will be viciously attacked, demonized and denied&#8230; up until the day they are finally embraced and accepted as the &#8220;new science of life.&#8221; In a hundred years, Sheldrake will likely be remembered as far more important to science than even Charles Darwin. His ideas are not merely revolutionary, but desperately needed to advance science beyond the limiting realm of materialism. If science does not expand its scope beyond chemical structures, it will never understand life and will always remain mystified and frustrated about why genes still don&#8217;t control much in the way of inheritance.</p>
<p>Watch for more coverage of Rupert Sheldrake here on Natural News, where our ideas are rooted in science yet not limited by the artificial confines of materialism. We also hope to interview Sheldrake soon and bring you the interview that <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/042112_TED_conferences_pseudoscience_GMO.html">TED won&#8217;t allow you to hear</a>.</p>
<h1>Questions for faith believers in materialist genetics</h1>
<p>1. Where is the gene for creativity? If creative works (songs, poems, fiction novels, etc.) are merely the work of mechanistic brains following genetic instructions, then all the lifelong works of creative individuals (musicians, artists, novelists, etc.) must somehow be encoded in the DNA before birth. Where is all this creativity encoded?</p>
<p>2. How does a blood cell know to make itself into a blood cell and not a skin cell?</p>
<p>3. Why is most physical inheritance unable to be traced to DNA? (The &#8220;heritability problem.&#8221;)</p>
<p>4. If there is not enough storage capacity in the human genome to fully describe the human form, then where does the rest of the blueprint come from?</p>
<p>5. Where is the genetic code for love, compassion and cooperation, without which human civilization never would have survived?</p>
<p>6. If human consciousness is an illusion, as materialists claim, then it can have no impact on human behavior, which is purely mechanistic, they insist. So then why did the &#8220;illusion of consciousness&#8221; evolve in human beings if it serves no purpose? This contradicts one of the more fundamental tenants of natural selection.</p>
<p>7. Are you, yourself, purely a mechanistic biological robot suffering under the illusion of consciousness? And if so, then why should we listen to anything you have to say in the first place?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shortly after 50,000 bees were found dead in an Oregon parking lot (read more <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/06/27/more-than-25000-thousand-bees-found-dead-in-oregon-parking-lot/">here</a>), a staggering 37 million bees have been found dead in Elmwood, Ontario, Canada. Dave Schuit, who runs a honey operation in Elmwood has lost 600 hives. He is pointing the finger at the insecticides known as neonicotinoids, which are manufactured by Bayer CropScience Inc. This also comes after a recent report released by the British Beekeepers Association (BBKA) that recorded its largest loss of honeybees ever. You can read more about that <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/06/13/largest-honeybee-loss-ever-recorded-in-the-united-kingdom/">here</a>.  The European Union has stepped forward, having banned multiple pesticides that have been linked to killing millions of bees. You can view the studies and read more about that <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/05/03/european-union-votes-to-ban-pesticides-linked-to-bee-deaths/">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The loss comes after the planting of corn. Neonicotinoid pesticides are used to coat corn seed with air seeders. This results in having the pesticide dust blown into the air when planted. The death of millions of pollinators was studied by Purdue University. They discovered that Bees exhibited neurotoxic symptoms. They analyzed dead bees and found that traces of thiamethoxam/clothiandin were present in each case. The only major source of these compounds are seed treatments of field crops. You can view that study<a href="http://extension.entm.purdue.edu/publications/E-53.pdf"> here</a> (1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bee deaths are increasing exponentially. An international team of scientists led by Holland’s Utrecht University has concluded that, “large scale prophylaxic use in agriculture, their high persistence in soil and water, and their uptake by plants and translocation to flowers, neonicotinoids put pollinators at risk. This is some of the research that led to the European Unions ban of the pesticides, as mentioned and referenced earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can we really debate this much longer? The evidence linking pesticides to bee deaths is overwhelming. It’s not only bees, but an array of other insects as well. The last thing we need is more events to occur that companies can use to push the manufacturing and development or more genetically modified foods. One reason that has been used for justification of GMO’s is a food shortage, and we all know how critical bees are to our food supply. There is a huge conflict of interest here, the pesticides used to spray the crops that are killing the bees are developed by biotech corporations such as Monsanto.</p>

<p>Time to make the connections, time to speak up!</p>

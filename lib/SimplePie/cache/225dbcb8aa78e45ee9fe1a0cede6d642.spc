It aims to succeed where others have failed by creating a gateway to Asian markets and building a Pacific-rim trade deal. The U.S. and Canada are both pursuing deeper ties with the group and have been granted observer status. This is part of efforts to revive and expand their presence in Latin America. In some areas of integration, the Pacific Alliance has surpassed NAFTA. By merging the two together, it could be used to fill the void left by the collapse of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). <br /><br />The <a href="http://alianzapacifico.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ABC-ALIANZA-DEL-PACIFICO-PRENSA-INGLES.pdf">Pacific Alliance</a> was officially launched by Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru in June 2012. Its objectives include to construct, “an area of profound market-driven economic integration that will contribute to the free movement of goods, services, capital and persons.” The group also seeks to, “become a platform for economic and commercial integration as well as political coordination with global outreach, particularly towards the Asia Pacific.” A key requirement in joining the Pacific Alliance is to have free trade agreements with all existing member states. Costa Rica recently received approval to become a permanent member. Other countries have also shown interest with a growing number requesting observers status. The goal of the Pacific Alliance is to go beyond traditional free trade deals and  pursue even more liberalized economic policies. <a name='more'></a><br /><br />The May 23, 2013 <a href="http://alianzapacifico.net/documents/cali_eng.pdf">Pacific Alliance Summit</a> in Cali, Colombia marked the next steps in the consolidation and deepening of the Latin American trade bloc. The presidents of the four founding member countries agreed to remove tariffs on 90 percent of the goods traded between them and to gradually eliminate duties on the remaining 10 percent. They also adopted measures to begin visa-free travel between member states and moved closer towards full labor mobility. In addition, the leaders announced the creation of a cooperation fund and ratified agreements to open up joint embassies and trade offices in Asia and Africa. They also pledged to continue to deepen regional financial integration. The stock markets of Chile, Peru and Colombia have already been merged together and Mexico is expected to join them within the next year. While other Latin American countries are seeking to curb U.S. influence, Pacific Alliance members have shown a willingness to maintain and increase ties with Washington. <br /><br />Just days after the Pacific Alliance Summit, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/27/remarks-press-vice-president-biden-and-colombian-president-santos-bogota">Vice President Joe Biden met with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos</a> where he praised the progress the economic bloc has made and also expressed interest in the U.S. joining as an observer country. On July 19, the Department of State <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/07/212205.htm">announced U.S. participation as an observer</a> in the group. While full membership may be far off, the U.S. is expanding cooperation with Alliance members. Over the years, there has been a steady erosion of U.S.-Latin American relations. Some analysts have pointed out that that both the <a href="http://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2013/08/05/Chomsky-Grip-on-North-America/">U.S. and Canada’s grip on Latin America is loosening</a>. This ties in with an article from <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/regime-change-u-s-seeks-to-get-rid-of-left-governments-in-latin-america/5344989">Global Research</a> which noted that the Obama administration is stepping up its strategy of regime change against the left-of-center governments in the region. The U.S. could use the Pacific Alliance as a means to recover political and economic influence in Latin America. <br /><br />When Prime Minister Stephen Harper <a href="http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=5502">attended the Pacific Alliance Summit</a> in May, it was expected that he would request full membership. Canada already <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/media_commerce/comm/news-communiques/2012/11/15a.aspx?lang=eng">achieved observer status</a> back in November 2012. While Harper acknowledged their accomplishments, he said that it was too soon to decide whether Canada should join the trade bloc. During his trip, Harper also took the opportunity to meet with mining company executives. The Conservative government has been criticized for not putting enough emphasis on corporate accountability with regards Canadian mining operations in the region. <a href="http://canadians.org/media/water/2013/23-May-13.html">Maude Barlow explained</a> that, “The Pacific Alliance, like Canada’s existing trade and investment deals in Latin America, puts the profits of those companies above anything else. The deals, like the Alliance, have nothing to say about the environmental and human rights impact of mining in the region.” The Pacific Alliance appears to be another attempt to accelerate the privatization of natural resources. It goes against the efforts of some Latin American countries that have joined together to <a href="http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2013/05/last-week-13-latin-american-governments-gathered-in-guayaquil-ecuador-to-hatch-a-common-response-to-an-increasingly-common-m.html">fight the growing problem of investor-state privileges</a> found in NAFTA-style trade agreements. These rules allow foreign corporations to sue for any potential profit losses related to government policies. <br /><br />A recent article by Eric Farnsworth advocated <a href="http://www.as-coa.org/articles/nafta-and-pacific-alliance">linking NAFTA with the Pacific Alliance</a>. He recommended that the leaders from both trade groups, “should consider meeting to forge a pragmatic economic agenda for cooperation. This offers an important opportunity to kick-start a common agenda with willing partners that has languished since the FTAA.” Farnsworth also described how, “building out a NAFTA-Pacific Alliance economic relationship would improve the collective regional approach toward the Asia-Pacific region, which currently includes precisely the same Western Hemisphere nations within APEC and the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations except Colombia. It would also offer a means to improve market efficiencies and update NAFTA without the need to re-open or re-negotiate its provisions.”  There is an overlap between the Pacific Alliance and the much larger <a href="http://www.citizenstrade.org/ctc/trade-policies/tpp-potential-trade-policy-problems/">TPP trade talks</a>. Both initiatives seek to bridge the Americas with Asia and create Pacific-based trade blocs. With the possibility of TPP negotiations dragging on and the difficulty the deal might have getting ratified by the U.S. Senate, the Pacific Alliance could open new doors to trade with Asian countries sooner. <br /><br />In Latin America, there is a growing divide over the future of continental political and economic integration. Some countries have banded together to resist U.S. imperialism and any attempts to destabilize the region. There is also a move to end the destructive cycle of investment treaties and replace it with an alternative economic structure that better respects the sovereignty of nation states. The Pacific Alliance stands as a counterbalance to some of the other regional integration efforts that are trying to protect against the dangers of globalization. It is designed to signal a commitment to free trade and open markets to its neighbours and to the rest of the world. In many ways, the Pacific Alliance represents a resurgence of the failed U.S. initiated FTAA which was part of an agenda to consolidate corporate control.<br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel:<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/06/using-tpp-to-renegotiate-and-expand.html">Using the TPP to Renegotiate and Expand NAFTA</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/11/canada-and-mexico-to-join-us-in-nafta.html">Canada and Mexico to Join U.S. in NAFTA of the Pacific</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2009/11/building-blocks-towards-asia-pacific.html">Building Blocks Towards an Asia-Pacific Union</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/12/beyond-nafta-shaping-future-of-north_10.html">Beyond NAFTA: Shaping the Future of North American Integration</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

width="373"  /></a></div><br />Canada recently took over the leadership of the Arctic Council and will be succeeded by the U.S. in 2015. With back-to-back chairmanships, it gives both countries an opportunity to increase cooperation on initiatives that could enhance the development of a shared North American vision for the Arctic. The U.S. has significant geopolitical and economic interests in the high north and have released a new national strategy which seeks to advance their Arctic ambitions. While the region has thus far been peaceful, stable and free of conflict, there is a danger of the militarization of the Arctic. It has the potential to become a front whereby the U.S. and other NATO members are pitted against Russia or even China. In an effort to prevent any misunderstandings, there are calls for the Arctic Council to move beyond environmental issues and become a forum to address defense and security matters. <br /><br />In May, <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/WET30-7/chairmanship-presidence.aspx?lang=eng">Canada assumed the chairmanship of the Arctic Council</a> where they will push for responsible resource development, safe shipping and sustainable circumpolar communities. The Arctic Council is the leading multilateral forum in the region and also includes the U.S., Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Russia. During the recent meetings, members signed an <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/05/209406.htm">Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response in the Arctic</a> which seeks to improve coordination and planning to better cope with any such accidents. In addition, China, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, along with Italy were granted permanent observer status in the Arctic Council. With the move, China has gained more influence in the region. The potential for new trade routes that could open up would significantly reduce the time needed to transport goods between Europe and Asia. The Arctic is an important part of China’s global vision, as a place for economic activity and a possible future mission for its navy. In order to better reflect the realities of politics in the high north, there are calls to expand the Arctic Council’s mandate to also include security and military issues. <a name='more'></a><br /><br />Writing for the <a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/05/06/arctic-piece-1-for-monday/">National Post</a>, Rob Huebert of the Canadian Defence & Foreign Affairs Institute explained that, “One issue that has not received much attention is the need to discuss the growing militarization of the Arctic. While the Arctic Council is formally forbidden from discussing military security in the Arctic, the time has arrived to rethink this policy.” He went on to say, “The militaries of most Arctic states are taking on new and expanded roles in the region that go beyond their traditional responsibilities, which may create friction in the region.” Huebert also stressed that, “These new developments need to be discussed to ensure that all Arctic Council member states understand why they are occurring, and increase the confidence of members that these new developments are not about a conflict in the Arctic, but about the defence of core strategic interests.” He further added, “It is easy to see how both the Americans and Russians will become increasingly concerned about the security steps that the other is taking. But now is the time for all to openly discuss these developments so that old suspicions and distrusts do not resurface.” <br /><br />As part of efforts to strengthen Arctic security cooperation, in June, the <a href="http://nouvelles.gc.ca/web/article-eng.do?nid=749589">Northern Chiefs of Defence Meeting</a> was held in Greenland. It brought together representatives from the U.S., Canada, Denmark, Russia, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland. <a href="http://www.norad.mil/Newsroom/tabid/3170/Article/2159/norad-and-usnorthcom-commander-to-attend-northern-chiefs-of-defence-meeting.aspx#.UbIVh4GrCnU.gmail">Gen. Charles Jacoby</a>, Commander of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) also attended the event. The second annual gathering was used as an, “opportunity for direct multilateral and bilateral discussions focused on Northern issues. Topics discussed included the sharing of knowledge and expertise about regional operational challenges; responsible stewardship of the North; and the role Northern militaries can play in support of their respective civil authorities.” The Northern Chiefs of Defence meeting has become an essential forum to address common Arctic safety and security concerns.<br /><br />Ahead of Secretary of State John Kerry's trip to attend the <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2013/05/209403.htm">Arctic Council Ministerial Session</a> in May, the White House unveiled a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/nat_arctic_strategy.pdf">National Strategy for the Arctic Region</a>. It outlined strategic priorities including advancing U.S. security interests, pursuing responsible stewardship and strengthening international cooperation. The document acknowledged competing environmental and economic goals, but in the end sets an aggressive agenda for the exploitation of Arctic oil, gas and mineral reserves. In addition, the strategy recommended enhancing national defense, law enforcement, navigation systems, environmental response, as well as search-and-rescue capabilities in the Arctic. It also builds off of <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nspd/nspd-66.htm">National Security Presidential Directive-66</a> issued by the Bush administration in 2009. In coordination with the new plan, the U.S. Coast Guard has released their <a href="http://www.uscg.mil/seniorleadership/DOCS/CG_Arctic_Strategy.pdf">Vision for Operating in the Arctic Region</a> which will work towards improving awareness, modernizing governance and broadening partnerships. According to <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2013/03/23/americas-airsea-battle-arctic-style/?all=true">James Holmes</a>, professor of strategy at the U.S. Naval War College, the Coast Guard and Air Force could become the military's odd couple in defending America's Arctic front.  <br /><br />Several months back, Congressman Don Young testified in front of Armed Services Committee in support of <a href="http://donyoung.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=333097">Alaska national defense priorities</a>. He proclaimed, “We must be able to project power into the Arctic environment and extensive Arctic training is needed to do that.” Some have pointed out that the true nature surrounding U.S. plans to shift additional missile interceptors to Alaska is not to protect against a North Korean threat, but is instead <a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/us-amd-korea-arctic-371/">aimed at control over Arctic resources</a>. Meanwhile, there have also been renewed discussions about <a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/canada-must-have-broader-discussion-about-missile-defence-toews-1.1247517">Canadian participation in the U.S. anti-ballistic missile shield</a>, a move that could damage relations with Russia and China. In order to enhance its presence and security in the Arctic, the U.S. is increasing cooperation with Canada. This includes expanding joint military exercises and intelligence gathering operations in the region. Professor <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/north-american-integration-and-the-militarization-of-the-arctic/6586">Michel Chossudovsky of Global Research</a> has described Washington’s militarization of the Arctic as part of the process of North American integration.  <br /><br />In December 2012, the U.S. and Canada signed the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130309233708/http://www.cjoc.forces.gc.ca/fs-ev/2012/12/Tri_Command_Arctic_Framework__final__En_29_Nov_2012.pdf">Tri-Command Framework for Arctic Cooperation</a> which is part of efforts to further merge USNORTHCOM, Canadian Joint Operations Command (CJOC) and NORAD. A <a href="http://www.northcom.mil/Newsroom/tabid/3104/Article/2956/norad-usnorthcom-and-canadian-joint-operations-commmand-commander-sign-cooperat.aspx">press release</a> explained that the framework is designed to, “promote enhanced military cooperation in the Arctic and identify specific areas of potential Tri-Command cooperation in the preparation for and conduct of safety, security and defense operations.” USNORTHCOM, CJOC and NORAD have also pledged to work closer together with regards to planning, domain awareness, information-sharing, training and exercises, capability development, as well as in the field of science and technology. In the coming years, the Arctic will become an even more important part of  North American perimeter security.<br /><br />While the Arctic remains a region of strategic interest to the alliance, Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently <a href="http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130529/DEFREG/305290022/NATO-Rejects-Direct-Arctic-Presence">rejected a direct NATO presence</a>. For a number of years, Norway has been pushing for NATO to increase its focus in the Arctic and have called for more <a href="http://barentsobserver.com/en/security/2013/02/wants-more-northern-nato-exercises-28-02">joint northern exercises</a>. Even though NATO has yet to truly define its role in the area, Arctic member countries are stepping up military and naval operations in the high north. In the future, NATO’s mandate could include economic infrastructure and maritime security. It could also serve as a forum for discussing Arctic military issues. Expanding NATO activity in the region might signal the militarization of the Arctic  which could raise tensions with both Russia and China.<br /><br />There are fears that the Arctic could become an arena for political and military competition. With potential new shipping routes and countries further staking their claims to the vast untapped natural resources, defending strategic and economic interests may lead to rivalries in the region. There is also the possibility that conflicts which originate in other parts of the world could spillover and affect the stability of the Arctic.<br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel:<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/12/the-tri-command-strategy-and-merging-us_30.html">The Tri-Command Strategy and Merging U.S.-Canada Arctic Foreign Policy</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2010/06/future-canada-us-joint-north-american.html">Future U.S.-Canada Joint Arctic Security and Control</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2010/11/nato-arctic-security-and-canadian.html">NATO Arctic Security and Canadian Sovereignty in the Far North</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2010/08/norad-russian-joint-air-drill-bomber.html">NORAD-Russian Joint Air Drill, Bomber Incursions and Canada’s F-35 Jet Purchase</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

addressed the CFR, a globalist think tank who have been a driving force behind the push towards deeper North American integration. The U.S. and Canada are now further advancing this agenda through the Beyond the Border agreement. Both countries are increasing bilateral border transportation and infrastructure coordination. This includes a common approach to border management, security and control. They are also integrating an information sharing system that would be used to track everyone crossing the U.S.-Canada border and entering or leaving the continent. Without much fanfare and seemingly little resistance, Canada is being assimilated into a U.S. dominated North American security perimeter.<br /><br />In May, the Conservative government <a href="http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/media/nr/2013/nr20130506-eng.aspx">highlighted</a> the benefits of the U.S.-Canada <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/wh/us-canada-btb-action-plan.pdf">Beyond the Border</a> action plan which was announced back in 2011. The deal, “focuses on addressing security threats at the earliest point possible and facilitating the lawful movement of people, goods, and services into Canada and the United States, and creates a long-term partnership to improve the management of our shared border.” The goal is to further increase, “security, economic competitiveness and prosperity through numerous measures, including reducing border wait times and improving infrastructure at key crossings to speed up legitimate trade and travel.” The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/05/10/canadian-and-us-officials-discuss-beyond-border-initiative">Beyond the Border Executive Steering Committee</a> recently met to discuss the objectives that have already been achieved and the work that still needs to be done. Another important facet of the economic and security perimeter agreement is the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/us-canada_rcc_joint_action_plan3.pdf">Regulatory Cooperation Council</a> action plan. A <a href="http://trade.gov/rcc/rcc-stakeholder-dialogue-discussion-06202013.asp">stakeholder dialogue session</a> is planned for June 20, which will review its implementation progress and will seek further input regarding the next stage of U.S.-Canada regulatory integration. <a name='more'></a><br /><br />Last month, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released a joint report on the findings of <a href="http://cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/newsroom/highlights/canada_usreport.ctt/canada_usreport.pdf">Phase I of the Entry/Exit Information System</a>. The program included collecting and exchanging biographic information at four selected land border ports of entry. In a <a href="http://www.cbsa.gc.ca/media/release-communique/2013/2013-05-13-eng.html">news release</a>, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Acting Commissioner Thomas Winkowski stated that, “The results of Phase I demonstrate the capacity of the United States and Canada to increase information sharing capabilities.” He added, “This kind of cooperation epitomizes the Beyond the Border Action Plan.” The next phase of the entry/exit initiative is set to begin at the end of this month. It will involve exchanging the biographic data collected from third-country nationals and permanent residents of Canada and the U. S. at all common ports of entry. Both countries are further merging databases and are expanding surveillance and intelligence gathering operations. In 2014, they will also start sharing biometric information at the border. This will further advance the creation of a North America security perimeter where all travellers will be tracked and traced in real time. <br /><br />As part of the commitment made under the Beyond the Border deal, both countries have announced the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/news/2013/05/30/united-states-and-canada-announce-first-ever-binational-border-infrastructure">Border Infrastructure Investment Plan</a> which was, “developed to establish a mutual understanding of recent, ongoing and potential border infrastructure investments. It outlines the approach that Canada and the United States will take to coordinate plans for physical infrastructure upgrades.” In June 2012, Canada reached an <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=4864">agreement</a> with the State of Michigan to build a second bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. This was followed by a presidential permit issued in April of this year that officially paved the way for construction of the project. A U.S. State Department <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/04/207424.htm">press release</a> explained that, “Consistent with the bilateral Beyond the Border Initiative, this permit contributes to ensuring that our border infrastructure supports increased competitiveness, job creation, and broad-based prosperity in the United States and Canada.” It went on to say that the new bridge, “will help to meet future capacity requirements in a critical travel corridor, promote cross-border trade and commerce, and advance our vital bilateral relationship with Canada.”<br /><br />In March, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano and Canada’s Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews signed a memorandum of understanding which established a <a href="http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/media/nr/2013/nr20130314-eng.aspx">truck cargo pre-inspection pilot project</a>. The joint undertaking is another component of the Beyond the Border agreement and would shift inspections and clearances away from the actual border crossing. The first phase, “will test the concept of conducting U.S. CBP primary cargo inspection in Canada, and will be implemented at the Pacific Highway crossing between Surrey, British Columbia and Blaine, Washington.” The second phase, “will further test how pre-inspection could enhance border efficiency and reduce wait times to facilitate legitimate trade and travel, and will be implemented at the Peace Bridge crossing between Fort Erie, Ontario and Buffalo, New York.” The perimeter security deal is laying the foundation for a future U.S.-Canada binational organization that would jointly manage and control the border.   <br /><br />The CBSA is also testing additional technology at the <a href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/media/release-communique/2013/2013-05-24-eng.html">Morses Line, Quebec</a> and <a href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/media/release-communique/2013/2013-05-24a-eng.html">Piney, Manitoba</a> ports of entry. Under the remote traveller pilot project, people entering either location after regular hours of service, “will be processed by a border services officer located at a remote processing centre through a two-way audio and one-way video kiosk. Cameras will be installed to provide the officer with the ability to see the traveller and the vehicle.” The program which could later be expanded to other areas , “is part of the <a href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/media/facts-faits/127-eng.html">Small and Remote Ports of Entry Initiative</a>, one of the deliverables under the Beyond the Border Action Plan.” <a href="http://www.naunewz.org/does-remote-location-border-security-make-you-feel-safer/">NAUNEWZ</a> pointed out that, “Although a lot of this technology is already installed and being utilized in limited ways at most of the main Canada-U.S. border crossing points, these smaller border crossings are ideal testing grounds for their ‘no borders’/NAU agenda.”<br /><br />On May 16, Canadian <a href="http://www.cfr.org/canada/conversation-stephen-harper/p30723">Prime Minister Stephen Harper participated</a> in question and answer session before the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). The conversation centered around economic growth, foreign investment and the role of the G20 with regards to global governance. Other issues focused on Canada-U.S. relations. Harper lobbied for approval of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline which would carry oil from western Canada to the Texas gulf coast. He dismissed environmental issues associated with the project and argued that it would be a step towards North American energy independence. The Obama administration is expected to make a final decision on the pipeline sometime this year. Harper also acknowledged the Beyond the Border and the Regulatory Cooperation Council action plans. He blamed sovereignty concerns and the continued negativity surrounding NAFTA as the main obstacles to even deeper continental integration. Prime Minister Harper used his audition in front of the CFR as an opportunity to demonstrate to the U.S. political and corporate elite that he is committed to defending the interests of big business and further pushing plans for a North American Union (NAU).<br /><br />The Beyond the Border action plan is the most significant step forward in U.S.-Canada cooperation since NAFTA. It provides the framework for future North American integration. When fully implemented, the agreement can be expanded and updated. So far, the agenda has quietly slipped under the radar. By incrementally incorporating various pilot projects and excluding Mexico from the process, it has managed to avoid the controversy of past initiatives. The perimeter security deal is being sold as vital to improving the flow of trade and travel across the border. In order to appease U.S. fears, Canada has made numerous concessions with no guarantees that it will lessen border restrictions. As part of a North American security perimeter, Canada will always be at the mercy of any new U.S. security measures, regardless of the dangers they may pose to privacy and civil liberties. <br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel:<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2013/02/us-canada-harmonizing-border-security.html">U.S.-Canada Harmonizing Border Security and Immigration Measures</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/10/new-border-regime-is-taking-us-canada_9.html">Taking the U.S.-Canada Partnership to the Next Level</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/12/the-tri-command-strategy-and-merging-us_30.html">Merging U.S.-Canada Arctic Foreign Policy</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2013/04/the-return-of-acta-us-dictating-canadas.html">The Return of ACTA: U.S. Dictating Canada’s Intellectual Property Laws</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

width="373" /></a></div><br />In March, the Canadian government introduced a bill that would bring about sweeping changes to its copyright and trademark laws. This includes giving more power to customs and border protection agents without any judicial oversight. The move is intended to prevent counterfeit goods from entering the country, but has been criticized for being less about protecting Canadians and more about caving to American demands. With the U.S. dictating global intellectual property standards, the new legislation represents the return of ACTA and would pave the way for Canada to ratify the controversial international treaty. <br /><br />Over the years, the U.S. has been critical of Canada's efforts in addressing trade in counterfeit goods and has been pressing for intellectual property reform. In the 2009 United States Trade Representative (USTR) <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/reports-and-publications/2009/2009-special-301-report">Special 301 Report</a>, Canada was placed on a priority watch list of countries that do not provide adequate intellectual property enforcement. As part of its <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/reports-and-publications/2013/2013-tpa-2012-ar">2013 Trade Policy Agenda</a>, the USTR is now pushing Canada to comply with the <a href="http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2012/01/20120125acta.pdf">Anti-Counterfeit Trade Agreement</a> (ACTA). The multinational treaty is designed to standardize intellectual property laws around the world. Although it has been signed by a number of countries, <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/media_commerce/comm/news-communiques/2011/280.aspx?view=d">including Canada</a>, so far only <a href="http://www.inta.org/Press/Pages/JapanRatifiesACTA.aspx">Japan has ratified ACTA</a>. It was the result of public pressure associated with risks to internet privacy and online freedom of speech which lead to <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20120703IPR48247/html/European-Parliament-rejects-ACTA">ACTA being rejected</a> by the European Parliament in July of 2012. At the time, many assumed that ACTA was dead, but it still remains a top priority for the U.S. and they are attempting to revive the discredited agreement by trying to get the six necessary ratifications for it to come into force. In an effort to satisfy U.S concerns, Canada recently announced legislation which is aimed at bringing them in line with ACTA. <a name='more'></a><br /><br />Last month, the Conservative government introduced <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&DocId=6013262&File=42">Bill C-56</a>, also known as the <a href="http://news.gc.ca/web/article-eng.do?mthd=tp&crtr.page=1&nid=723359">Combating Counterfeit Products Act</a>. Academic researcher and law professor <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6796/125/">Michael Geist</a> explained how the proposed legislation would, “ensure that Canada is positioned to ratify ACTA by addressing border measures provisions. The core elements of the bill include the increased criminalization of copyright and trademark law as well as the introduction of new powers for Canadian border guards to detain shipments and work actively with rights holders to seize and destroy goods without court oversight or involvement.” He emphasized that, “Customs officials are not copyright and trademark experts, yet they may now be forced to assess infringement cases including determining whether any copyright exceptions apply.” <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130301/12143622173/ustr-to-canada-bow-down-accept-acta-canada-yes-we-shall-do-your-bidding.shtml">Mike Masnick</a> of techdirt acknowledged that, “For many years, Canada has strongly resisted U.S.-style copyright laws, despite tremendous pressure to do so. Watching them cave on ACTA is certainly a disappointment.” He went on to say, “It shows a Canadian government who doesn't seem to care about what the public wants, but rather feels the need to kowtow to U.S. entertainment and pharmaceutical lobbying interests.”<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.canadians.org/media/trade/2013/05-Mar-13.html">Council of Canadians</a> have questioned whether the anti-counterfeiting bill, “is one of the conditions the U.S. government put on Canada joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade negotiations.” The group is urging that intellectual property rights be taken out of the TPP and the Canada-European Union (EU) Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) talks. There have already been attempts to use CETA negotiations to <a href="http://www.thestar.com/business/2012/07/07/controversial_copyright_rules_threaten_canada_european_trade_deal.html">sneak in parts of ACTA</a>. Stuart Trew, trade campaigner with the Council of Canadians wondered since, “The Harper government seems to have just collapsed in front of U.S. demands for border enforcement of Hollywood’s intellectual property rights despite the global controversy with ACTA. Can we expect Harper to bend this easily to European demands in CETA and U.S. demands in the TPP that will increase the price of drugs and undermine access to affordable medicines?” ACTA also favours Big Pharma with patent protections that would limit generic competition and would lead to higher drug costs. <br /><br />On March 20, the USTR officially <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/sites/default/files/03202013%20TTIP%20Notification%20Letter.PDF">notified</a> Congress of its intention to enter into negotiations with the EU on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreement. In the letter, they also outlined specific goals in different areas such as intellectual property rights. As part of the transatlantic talks, the USTR, “Seek to obtain, consistent with U.S. priorities and objectives, appropriate commitments that reflect the shared U.S.-EU objective of high-level IPR protection and enforcement, and to sustain and enhance joint leadership on IPR issues.” A <a href="http://www.citizen.org/IP-out-of-TAFTA">Civil Society Declaration</a> signed by European and U.S. groups is insisting that the upcoming negotiations, “exclude any provisions related to patents, copyright, trademarks, data protection, geographical indications, or other forms of so-called intellectual property. Such provisions could impede our rights to health, culture, and free expression and otherwise affect our daily lives.” Some have warned that the TTIP could be used as a way to implement ACTA through the backdoor. <br /><br />ACTA is part of the international agenda of patent, trademark and copyright lobbies. The agreement favours big businesses over individual innovators and creators. It was designed to protect the interests of multinational corporations at the expense of fundamental civil rights. ACTA is being used by the U.S. to pressure other countries into adopting a new global standard for intellectual property enforcement. The supranational treaty would impose draconian laws which threaten the sovereignty of member nations. <br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel:<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2013/03/final-push-for-canada-eu-ceta-and.html">Final Push for CETA and the Coming NAFTA-EU Free Trade Zone</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/08/growing-opposition-to-canada-eu-trade.html">Growing Opposition to the Canada-EU Trade Agreement</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/06/using-tpp-to-renegotiate-and-expand.html">Using the TPP to Renegotiate and Expand NAFTA</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2013/02/us-eu-trade-deal-is-foundation-for-new_25.html">U.S.-EU Trade Deal is the Foundation For a New Global Economic Order</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

/></a></div><br />Pressure is mounting on Canada to finish up a long-delayed trade deal with the EU. Despite outstanding issues that still must be settled, there is a final push to try and complete an agreement this summer. If both sides are able to secure a deal, it would lay the groundwork for the proposed U.S.-EU trade pact. There is the possibility that the U.S.-EU transatlantic trade talks could also include the other NAFTA partners and maybe even other countries. Mexico has already shown interest in joining and if Canada can’t put the final touches on their own agreement with the EU, they might also be part of the negotiations. This would facilitate plans for a coming NAFTA-EU free trade zone and the formation of a transatlantic economic union.<br /><br />After almost four years, negotiations between Canada and the European Union (EU) on a <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/eu-ue/negotiations-negociations.aspx?lang=eng&view=d">Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement</a> (CETA) are bogged down in the final stages. Both sides have missed numerous deadlines to wrap things up. There is uncertainty when or if CETA will even get done. Prime Minister Stephen Harper recently tried to boost trade talks. He acknowledged that <a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/harper-french-pm-tout-progress-toward-eu-trade-deal-1.1196051">considerable progress</a> towards a free trade deal has already been achieved, but admitted that there are still important issues that need to be resolved before any agreement can be finalized. Harper also explained that it would be to Canada’s advantage to sign a deal with Europe before the U.S. does. He made the comments while meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault who was in Ottawa for an official visit. As part of a <a href="http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=5362">joint statement</a>, both leaders said they looked forward to a successful conclusion to CETA negotiations. Before his trip to Canada, Ayrault was <a href="http://tradejustice.ca/en/section/28">sent a letter</a> by civil society groups voicing opposition to CETA and the investor protection chapter that would grant corporations the power to challenge government policies that restrict their profits. <a name='more'></a><br /><br />There are key issues which remain <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2013/03/06/pol-canada-eu-talks.html">stumbling blocks</a> and are preventing Canada and the EU from reaching an agreement. Academic researcher and law professor <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6808/125/">Michael Geist</a> argued that, “with the EU the stronger of the two parties, it doesn't see any urgency to compromise. In fact, with a growing number of EU negotiations (including talks with the U.S.), compromise with Canada may undermine its position in more economically important deals.” He also laid out different possibilities for the future of CETA. This includes Canada continuing to hold out hope for a compromise which thus far has failed. They could cave to the EU demands, but this might hurt the Conservatives chances in the 2015 election. Geist pointed out another scenario which would involve Canada joining the U.S.-EU talks and CETA being replaced by the Transatlantic Free Trade Area (TAFTA). He noted, “The argument for TAFTA would be that Canada is consolidating its negotiations into major agreements covering the Pacific (TPP) and Atlantic (TAFTA) to ensure that it is part of two potential large trading blocks. The danger with this approach is that Canada becomes a bit player in both negotiations with even less leverage to promote Canadian interests.”<br /><br />During a <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-12-825_en.htm">speech</a> given in November of last year, EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht called on Mexico and the EU to modernize their existing trade agreement. Glyn Moody of <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130313/10181122311/mexico-will-ask-to-join-us-eu-transatlantic-trade-agreement.shtml">techdirt</a> recently reported that Mexico is now looking to join the U.S.-EU transatlantic deal. This would be one way for the EU and Mexico to upgrade trade relations. Moody emphasized that the U.S. strategy is to, “make TPP the defining international agreement for the entire Pacific region. TAFTA obviously aims to do the same for the Atlantic. As well as establishing the U.S. as the key link between the giant TPP and TAFTA blocs, this double-headed approach would also isolate the main emerging economies -- Brazil, Russia, India and above all China.” Just like the U.S. dominated <a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/06/using-tpp-to-renegotiate-and-expand.html">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP), Mexico and Canada could also be a part of the <a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2013/02/us-eu-trade-deal-is-foundation-for-new_25.html">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> talks. This would make it a true NAFTA-EU trade bloc-level negotiations. There might be an opportunity for other countries to join as <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-eyes-involving-in-eu-us-free-trade.aspx?pageID=238&nID=43640&NewsCatID=344">Turkey is also pushing to be included</a> in the trade deal.<br /><br />In a recent article, <a href="http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/maude-barlow/2013/03/why-transatlantic-free-trade-mistake-canada">Maude Barlow</a> of the Council of Canadians described how CETA negotiations have laid the groundwork for a U.S.-EU free trade zone. She insisted that it would be a mistake for all three NAFTA countries to be a  part of a transatlantic agreement. Barlow warned about some of the same dangers found in CETA that the U.S. could face in their own trade deal with the EU. She stressed how opening up local procurement to the EU should be of great concern to U.S. states and municipal governments. In Canada, a number of municipalities have passed motions demanding that they be excluded from the procurement rules in CETA which would restrict local hiring and purchasing initiatives. Barlow also cautioned that an investor protection chapter like the one in CETA would allow European multinationals to sue for any potential profit losses related to U.S. government policies and regulations. This would be worse than <a href="http://www.citizen.org/Page.aspx?pid=1218">NAFTA’s Chapter 11</a> and as a result, the U.S. would lose more sovereign rights. The <a href="http://www.dfat.gov.au/publications/trade/trading-our-way-to-more-jobs-and-prosperity.html">Australian government</a> has already stopped the practice of including investor-state dispute resolution procedures in trade agreements and now it’s time for other countries follow suit.<br /><br />In Canada, opposition to CETA continuous to grow. There are deep concerns over the expansion of NAFTA-like investor rights, the dismantling of supply management in agriculture and the negative impact that CETA would have on local public procurement. It could also serve to further empower Big Pharma by extending monopoly drug patents  which would lead to higher costs. Just like any of the other so-called next-generation trade and investment deals, CETA is based on the failed NAFTA model with the same false promises. These secretive and binding international agreements are not really about trade, but are in fact designed to reshape regulatory and policy frameworks to further increase the rights of corporations and investors.<br /><br />Whatever happens with CETA will greatly affect how the U.S. and EU approach their own trade deal. Moving forward, the merging transatlantic partnership will eventually culminate in the creation of a NAFTA-EU free trade zone.

Such an agreement would be the basis for the creation of an economic NATO and would include trade in goods, services and investment, as well as cover intellectual property rights. There are concerns that the U.S. could use these talks to push the EU to loosen its restrictions on genetically modified crops and foods. In addition, the deal might serve as a backdoor means to implement ACTA which was rejected by the European Parliament last year. A U.S.-EU Transatlantic trade agreement is seen as a way of countering China’s growing power and is the foundation for a new global economic order.<br /><br />In his recent <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/remarks-president-state-union-address">State of the Union</a> address, President Barack Obama officially announced that the U.S. would launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union (EU). A <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/13/statement-united-states-president-barack-obama-european-council-presiden">joint statement</a> issued by European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy and U.S. President Obama explained that, “Through this negotiation, the United States and the European Union will have the opportunity not only to expand trade and investment across the Atlantic, but also to contribute to the development of global rules that can strengthen the multilateral trading system.” In a separate <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-13-121_en.htm">speech</a>, European Commission President Barroso also emphasized that, “A future deal between the world's two most important economic powers will be a game-changer. Together, we will form the largest free trade zone in the world. So this negotiation will set the standard – not only for our future bilateral trade and investment, including regulatory issues, but also for the development of global trade rules.” <a name='more'></a><br /><br />The decision to pursue a free trade deal was based on the recommendations put forth by the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/28/fact-sheet-high-level-working-group-jobs-and-growth">High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth</a> which was created to deepen U.S.-EU economic integration. In their <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/reports-and-publications/2013/final-report-us-eu-hlwg">final report</a>, they called on leaders from both sides to, “initiate as soon as possible the formal domestic procedures necessary to launch negotiations on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement.” According to U.S. and EU officials, talks could start in June with the hopes of completing a deal by the end of 2014. The proposed trade pact would include removing import tariffs, dismantling hurdles to trade in goods, services, and investment, as well as harmonizing regulations and standards. It would also cover intellectual property protection and enforcement. This could be used as an opportunity for a backdoor implementation of the <a href="http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2012/01/20120125acta.pdf">Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement</a> (ACTA). It was a result of public pressure associated with risks to internet freedom and privacy which lead to ACTA being <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20120703IPR48247/html/European-Parliament-rejects-ACTA">rejected</a> by the European Parliament in July of 2012. There have already been attempts to use Canada-EU trade negotiations to <a href="http://www.thestar.com/business/2012/07/07/controversial_copyright_rules_threaten_canada_european_trade_deal.html">sneak in parts of ACTA</a>.<br /><br />Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch Director, <a href="http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2013/02/sotu-tpp-tafta-wtf.html">Lori Wallach</a> cautioned how U.S.-EU talks, “are aimed at eliminating a list of what multinational corporations call ‘trade irritants’ but the rest of us know as strong food safety, environmental and health safeguards.” She went on to say, “European firms are targeting aspects of the U.S. financial reregulation regime, our stronger drug and medical device safety and testing standards and more.” Wallach further added, “U.S. firms want Europe to gut their superior chemical regulation regime, their tougher food safety rules and labeling of genetically modified foods.” In a <a href="http://earthopensource.org/index.php/news/140-eu-us-free-trade-deal-will-dismantle-eu-public-health-protections-on-gm-foods">press release</a>, Earth Open Source warned that, “An EU-U.S. free trade deal would obliterate EU safeguards for health and the environment with regard to genetically modified (GM) crops and foods.” Research Director Claire Robinson pointed out, “If the new trade agreement goes through, it will be illegal under World Trade Organisation rules for the EU to have a stronger regulatory system for GMOs than the U.S. system.” This is disturbing considering that in many cases, GM foods in the U.S. do not require any special regulatory oversight or safety tests.<br /><br />Overshadowed by the proposed U.S.-EU trade deal is ongoing Canada-EU negotiations on a <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/eu-ue/negotiations-negociations.aspx?lang=eng&view=d">Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement</a> (CETA). Despite talks being in their final stages, both sides still have some important gaps to be bridged before a deal can be reached. <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/02/13/harpers_canadaeu_trade_deal_could_cost_canada_more_now_that_us_is_in_mix_walkom.html">Thomas Walkom</a> of the Toronto Star acknowledged that, “Europe’s real interest in negotiating a trade deal with Ottawa was to demonstrate to the Americans that a trans-Atlantic free trade pact was possible.” He noted, “EU negotiators will be even more reluctant to make concessions to Canada for fear of weakening their bargaining hand with the Americans.” Walkom argued that, “Canada is under more pressure to make a deal while Europe is under less.” He concluded that. “A Canada-EU deal seems inevitable. But now, with America in the mix, the terms for Canada may be even less favorable than expected.” The <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/no-trade-deal-unless-canada-offers-more-says-eu-commissioner/article8922931/">Globe and Mail</a> recently reported that the EU is demanding additional concessions from Canada before any agreement can be signed. In order to wrap things up, a desperate Canada may be willing to give up even more. This was a bad deal from the start and it would be in their best interest to just <a href="http://canadians.org/action/2013/harper-ceta.html">walk away from CETA</a>.<br /><br />In the coming months, you can expect the anti-corporate globalization movement on both sides of the Atlantic to mobilize against the U.S.-EU trade agreement. It is big business and financial institutions who are pushing this deregulation agenda which threatens health, environmental and food safety standards. Just like NAFTA, the proposed U.S.-EU trade deal is also likely to include an investor-state dispute process which would give corporations the right to challenge government policies that restrict their profits. A trade agreement between the U.S. and EU is the building blocks for a new global trading system. If you combine NAFTA, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and a U.S,-EU Transatlantic trade deal, you have the makings for a global free trade area.<br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel:<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/10/deepening-us-eu-transatlantic-trade_28.html">Deepening the U.S.-EU Transatlantic Trade Partnership</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/08/growing-opposition-to-canada-eu-trade.html">Growing Opposition to the Canada-EU Trade Agreement</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2010/03/advancing-transatlantic-agenda.html">Advancing the Transatlantic Agenda</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/01/from-nafta-to-ceta-canada-eu-deep.html">From NAFTA to CETA: Canada-EU Deep Economic Integration</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

progress in advancing the Beyond the Border deal and continue to implement various perimeter security initiatives. Without much fanfare, they have signed an immigration agreement that would allow them to share biographic and at a later date, biometric information. As part of a North American security perimeter, both countries are further harmonizing border security and immigration measures. Canada is further taking on U.S. security priorities and this could include a bigger role in the war on terrorism.<br /><br />It’s been over a year since Prime Minister Stephen Harper and President Barack Obama announced the <a href="http://photos.state.gov/libraries/canada/303578/pdfs/us-canada-btb_action_plan.pdf">Beyond the Border</a> and the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/us-canada_rcc_joint_action_plan3.pdf">Regulatory Cooperation Council</a> action plans. On December 14, 2012, the U.S. and Canada issued the Beyond the Border <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/btb_implementation_report.pdf">implementation report</a> that highlights the objectives that were achieved over the past year and the work that has yet to be done. It explained that moving forward, “Key future initiatives include harmonizing our trusted trader programs, making significant infrastructure investments at our key land border crossings, fully implementing an entry/exit program at the land border, expanding preclearance operations to the land, rail, and marine domains.” The report also acknowledged challenges facing the Next-Generation pilot project which would permit teams of cross-designated officers to operate on both sides of the border. It was originally scheduled to begin last summer. While steady progress has been made, a lot more work is needed to meet the goals of the Beyond the Border action plan. Over the next several years, other aspects of the deal will be phased-in incrementally with specific deliverables due this year, in 2014 and also in 2015. <a name='more'></a>  <br /><br />Another important facet of the economic and security perimeter agreement is the U.S.-Canada Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC). A <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/pco_bnet-30471-v38-rcc-progress_report_-_dec_2012_final.pdf">progress report</a> to the leaders outlines accomplishments made in aligning regulations in the areas of agriculture and food, transportation, the environment, health and personal care products, workplace chemicals, as well as nanotechnology. This includes cooperation on pilot projects, scientific and technical collaborations and harmonized testing procedures. RCC working groups have developed detailed <a href="http://www.trade.gov/rcc/">work plans</a> for the various initiatives with objectives that will be implemented over the next couple of years. In Canada, some fear that deepening regulatory integration with the U.S. could weaken and erode any independent regulatory capacity. This could lead to a race to the bottom with respect to regulatory standards. <br /><br />In December of last year, the U.S. and Canada signed the <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/releases/2012/2012-12-13.asp">Immigration Information Sharing Treaty</a> which is tied to the Beyond the Border deal. Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism Minister Jason Kenney stated that the, “agreement builds on our countries’ mutual efforts to protect our common borders and the surrounding perimeter, through improved screening of immigrants and visitors.” He went on to say, “Enhanced information sharing of foreign nationals will protect the safety and security of Canadians by helping us prevent terrorists, violent criminals, and others, who pose a risk, from entering Canada or the United States.” Under the treaty, Canada and the U.S. will share biographic information from third country nationals who apply for a visa, a travel permit or claim asylum. In 2014, it will also include the sharing of biometric information. There are privacy concerns on how far-reaching the data collected will be shared. This threatens the sovereignty of Canada with regards to retaining control over information at its own borders. <br /><br />On December 28, 2012, President Obama signed into law, the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr3783/text">Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act</a> which is designed to curb Iran's presence and activity in the region. The bill calls on the Department of Homeland Security to work with Canada and Mexico, “to address resources, technology, and infrastructure to create a secure United States border and strengthen the ability of the United States and its allies to prevent operatives from Iran, the IRGC, its Qods Force, Hezbollah, or any other terrorist organization from entering the United States.” Julie Carmichael, spokeswoman for Public Safety Minister Vic Toews discussed Canada’s efforts to counter any perceived hostility from Iran in the Americas. She is quoted in the <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-working-with-washington-to-counter-an-iranian-threat-in-the-americas/article6840442/">Globe and Mail</a> as saying, “We continually assess threats while co-operating with international partners, including the U.S., to address threats to our common security.” Carmichael added, “The Beyond the Border Action Plan as announced by Prime Minister Harper and President Obama provides a framework to identify threats before they reach North America.” Under the perimeter security deal, Canada is further aligning itself with U.S. foreign policy interests and could be expected to play a greater role in the global war on terror.  <br /><br />Through the Beyond the Border agreement, the U.S. and Canada are deepening economic and security integration which is laying the foundation for a North American security perimeter. Both countries are also engaged in the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations with Mexico and other member nations. This is part of efforts to create a free trade area of the Asia-Pacific and could be used to update and expand NAFTA. Another key priority for U.S.-Canada relations is North America’s energy future. President Obama is expected to make a final decision on the Keystone XL pipeline sometime this year. Meanwhile, there is growing environmental opposition to the proposed project which would carry oil from western Canada to the Texas gulf coast.  <br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel:<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/12/the-tri-command-strategy-and-merging-us_30.html">Merging U.S.-Canada Arctic Foreign Policy</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/11/us-canada-integrated-cybersecurity_7564.html">U.S.-Canada Integrated Cybersecurity Agenda</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/12/beyond-nafta-shaping-future-of-north_10.html">Shaping the Future of North American Integration</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/10/new-border-regime-is-taking-us-canada_9.html">Taking the U.S.-Canada Partnership to the Next Level</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

/>The Arctic has become an important part of North American perimeter security. Recently, the U.S. and Canada signed two new agreements that will expand bilateral military training, security and defense operations in the region. Both countries are working together to prepare for any real or perceived threats and are moving towards merging their Arctic foreign policies.<br /><br />On December 11, 2012, the U.S. and Canada signed the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130309233708/http://www.cjoc.forces.gc.ca/fs-ev/2012/12/Tri_Command_Arctic_Framework__final__En_29_Nov_2012.pdf">Tri-Command Framework for Arctic Cooperation</a> which will further integrate United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), Canadian Joint Operations Command (CJOC) and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). According to a <a href="http://www.northcom.mil/Newsroom/tabid/3104/Article/2956/norad-usnorthcom-and-canadian-joint-operations-commmand-commander-sign-cooperat.aspx">press release</a>, the framework is designed to, “promote enhanced military cooperation in the Arctic and identify specific areas of potential Tri-Command cooperation in the preparation for and conduct of safety, security and defense operations.” USNORTHCOM, CJOC and NORAD will work more closely in the region with regards to planning, domain awareness, information-sharing, training and exercises, operations, capability development, as well as in the area of science and technology. This also ties in with the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130528185041/http://www.cjoc.forces.gc.ca/fs-ev/2012/12/Tri_Command_Training_Exercise_Statement_of_Intent.pdf">Tri-Command Training and Exercise Statement of Intent</a>. The newly signed military document is aimed at, “enhancing joint and combined readiness in support of safety, security and defense missions through combined training and exercises and reinforcing partnerships and collaboration among the Commands.” <a name='more'></a> <br /><br />The latest U.S.-Canada military agreements are part of the Tri-Command strategy and demonstrate the importance being placed on the Arctic. The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130218085010/http://www.northcom.mil/News/Signed%20Vision%20in%20English%2012%20Mar%2010.pdf">Tri-Command Vision</a> has previously called for USNORTHCOM, NORAD and Canada Command which has now been replaced by CJOC to, “Improve unity of effort with each other and with our respective mission partners; develop a culture of continuous collaboration and cooperation in planning, execution, training, information management, and innovation; enhance intelligence and information sharing and fusion.” In order to better achieve these objectives, “The Commands shall develop and share comprehensive, situational awareness and a common operating picture, and must strive to interact seamlessly with each other and with our respective civil authorities, non-governmental organizations and other mission partners.” The Tri-Command is part of efforts to merge both countries, security and military priorities under the umbrella of a single, U.S.-dominated North American Command. <br /><br />As part of the April 2011 U.S. Department of Defense <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=14398">Unified Command Plan</a>, responsibility for the Arctic region is now shared between USNORTHCOM and USEUCOM. With the move, USNORTHCOM was given the primary task of planning and advocating for future Arctic capabilities, as well as engaging with stakeholders across the U.S. military, other agencies and international bodies. This is significant considering USNORTHCOM’s partnership with CJOC, along with NORAD and was instrumental in the development of the Tri-Command Framework for Arctic Cooperation. In an example of what we can expect with regards to joint Arctic security, Canada’s 2010 military sovereignty exercise, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120910031153/http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/v2/nr-sp/index-eng.asp?id=10905">Operation Nanook</a> included the U.S. and Denmark. The Arctic is also an emerging issue for the NATO alliance. Canada and the U.S., along with other NATO member countries have participated in the annual <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/top-of-the-world-nato-rehearses-for-war-in-the-arctic/30508">Cold Response</a> war games. Strengthening its military presence in the region and enhancing security collaboration with Canada and other northern partners has become an essential component of America’s Arctic strategy. <br /><br />In mid-2013, Canada will begin chairing a two-year term of the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/05/29/arctic-council-agenda_n_1553368.html">Arctic Council</a> with the U.S. assuming the leadership role from 2015–17. Many view this as an opportunity for both countries to advance a North American Arctic agenda. The intergovernmental forum which also includes Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Russia promotes cooperation, coordination and interaction among the Arctic states. The Arctic Council has signed an <a href="http://www.arctic-council.org/index.php/en/environment-and-people/oceans/search-and-rescue/157-sar-agreement">Agreement on Cooperation in Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue</a> which became the first legally binding deal ever negotiated between all the eight Arctic nations. As far as military and security concerns go, in April 2012, Canada hosted a meeting of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130528213318/http://forces.gc.ca/site/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-eng.asp?id=4151">Northern Chiefs of Defence</a> to discuss shared Arctic interests. This included common safety and security issues in the region such as emergency response and support to civilian authorities. The conference provided a setting to hold multilateral and bilateral talks focused on the Arctic and there are calls to have similar meetings on a regular basis. <br /><br />The U.S. and Canada share similar goals and concerns in the Arctic and are further building up their military presence in the region. With a strategic framework in place, both countries are working towards establishing a North American Arctic foreign policy. At times, Canadian and Russian rhetoric in regards to Arctic sovereignty has been reminiscent of the Cold War era. Rising tensions could further escalate the militarization of the far north. Increasing diplomatic efforts is the key to building the foundation for more multilateral cooperation in the area. While the process to resolve territorial disputes and the scramble to secure resources has thus far been peaceful, the Arctic still remains a potential flashpoint for conflict.<br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/02/us-canada-strengthening-security.html">Strengthening U.S.-Canada Security Interests in North America</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2010/06/future-canada-us-joint-north-american.html">Future U.S.-Canada Joint Arctic Security and Control</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2010/11/nato-arctic-security-and-canadian.html">NATO Arctic Security and Canadian Sovereignty</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/06/perimeter-security-and-integrated-north.html">Perimeter Security and an Integrated North American Command</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

placed on the NAFTA partnership, Mexico’s new president visited the U.S. and Canada before his inauguration. This was seen as a step forward in further strengthening political, economic, energy and security ties between all three countries. Other recent high-level meetings and policy papers are also shaping the future of North American integration. <br /><br />Before his recent trip to the U.S., Mexico’s new President Enrique Pena Nieto emphasized in a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/enrique-pena-nieto-us-mexico-should-develop-their-economic-bond/2012/11/23/248b8ec4-3589-11e2-9cfa-e41bac906cc9_story.html">Washington Post</a> editorial the opportunity both countries have to build on their economic partnership. He explained that, “in NAFTA we have a solid foundation to further integrate our economies through greater investments in finance, infrastructure, manufacturing and energy.” As part of his government’s strategy to reduce violence, he stated that it is, “important that our countries increase intelligence-sharing and crime-fighting techniques and promote cooperation among law enforcement agencies.” In a White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/11/28/remarks-president-obama-and-president-elect-pe-nieto-mexico-bilateral-me">press release</a>, Pena Nieto invited President Barack Obama to participate in the next North American Leaders Summit which will take place in Mexico sometime in 2013. With regards to U.S.-Mexico relations, Obama said that he was also looking forward to finding ways, “to strengthen our economic ties, our trade ties, our coordination along the border, improving our joint competitiveness, as well as common security issues.” <a name='more'></a> <br /><br />According to the new policy brief, <a href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/a_new_agenda_with_mexico.pdf">A New Agenda with Mexico</a> put out by the Woodrow Wilson Center, “declines in illegal immigration and organized crime violence in Mexico, open up an opportunity for U.S. policymakers to deepen the economic relationship.” The report recommended working, “together with Mexico and Canada to strengthen regional competitiveness and to grow North American exports to the world.” It further elaborated on how, “Economic issues can drive the next phase in deepening U.S.-Mexico cooperation. Investments in trusted shipper programs, pre-inspection programs, and enhanced border infrastructure will be crucial.” The study called on Washington to offer more, “support for Mexico’s criminal justice institutions, and strengthen U.S. anti-money laundering efforts in order to combat organized crime and violence.” It also recommended engaging, “Mexico more actively on hemispheric and extra-hemispheric foreign policy issues, ranging from terrorism to international trade and finance, as Mexico’s role as a global power grows.”<br /><br />In a recent article, <a href="http://www.cipamericas.org/archives/8435">Laura Carlsen</a>, director of the Americas Policy Program scrutinized some the new Mexican president’s policy initiatives. In the area of security, she pointed out that, “A real change in paradigm would require two measures that the Pena government has said it will not take: withdrawing the armed forces from counternarcotics efforts and renegotiating security cooperation with the U.S. government.” She noted,  “Pena Nieto has reassured the U.S. that his administration will continue the drug war.” Carlsen acknowledged how, “The U.S. government has actively promoted and supported the drug war model of enforcement and interdiction through the <a href="http://www.state.gov/j/inl/merida/">Merida Initiative</a> and spearheaded the massive expansion of U.S. counternarcotics activities in the country.” She further added, “U.S. defense, intelligence and security companies depend on the Mexican drug war to obtain multi-million dollar government contracts. The Pentagon and other U.S. agencies have achieved unprecedented freedom to act and even direct actions on Mexican soil.” As far as economic policy goes, Carlsen was also critical of President Pena Nieto’s commitment to deepen rather than fix NAFTA.<br /><br />Just days before being sworn in as Mexico's new president, Pena Nieto also visited Canada. In a <a href="http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=3&featureId=6&pageId=49&id=5182">press statement</a>, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said he was looking forward to working with him in improving trade ties, as well as strengthening North American competitiveness and security. In an editorial that appeared in the <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/for-mexico-and-canada-theres-room-to-grow/article5698332/">Globe and Mail</a>, Pena Nieto announced that, “One of the areas with the largest potential for co-operation between Mexico and Canada is energy production and development. Mexico’s energy sector is about to change. I want to enhance its potential by opening it up to national and foreign private investment.” He went on to say, “We can cultivate a closer relationship in this area in order to attain North American energy security.” Canada-U.S. energy issues are also at the forefront. Following his re-election, President Obama is under pressure to <a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/obama-under-pressure-to-revisit-keystone-xl-pipeline-decision-1.1061822">make a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline</a>. The proposed project would carry oil from western Canada to the Texas gulf coast.<br /><br />In the report, <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Reports/2012/11/canada%20mexico%20rozental/canada%20mexico%20relations%20rozental.pdf">Forging a New Strategic Partnership between Canada and Mexico</a>, Perrin Beatty and Andres Rozental recognized the opportunity both countries have to reshape bilateral relations. Among other things, the policy paper recommended removing the visa requirement for Mexican visitors to Canada. It supported increasing funding to the <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/crime/accbp-prclc.aspx?view=d">Anti-Crime Capacity Building Program</a> which is aimed at enhancing the ability, “of government agencies, international organizations and non-governmental entities to prevent and respond to threats posed by transnational criminal activity throughout the Americas.” In addition, the study called for institutionalizing the North American Leaders Summit and establishing a complementary North American Business Council. It also advocated pursuing further economic cooperation with the U.S. on a pragmatic basis and suggested that, “Ongoing border and regulatory initiatives should be results-oriented and pursued in the most effective way possible, bilateral or trilateral, as the case may be. This policy recommendation can be extended to any North American issue, including continental security perimeter initiatives and anti-narcotics efforts.”<br /><br />Last month’s <a href="http://www.nafta20.com/">NAFTA20 North America Summit</a> examined NAFTA’s evolution, as well as its future prospects. Speaking at the conference, <a href="http://www.uschamber.com/press/speeches/2012/nafta20-north-america-summit-remarks-thomas-j-donohue-president-and-ceo-us-chamb">Thomas Donohue</a> President and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Canadian, Mexican and U.S. leaders to move forward with, “the integration of our markets to further rationalize our supply chains, increase efficiency, and better position North America in the global economy.” He went on to say, “We need to advance regulatory cooperation, streamline our border, and reform immigration practices to ensure the free flow of products, people, capital, and ideas.” Donohue concluded that <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/media_commerce/comm/news-communiques/2012/10/09a.aspx?view=d">Canada</a> and <a href="http://www.economia.gob.mx/news-and-events/press-room/headlines/8957-boletin234-12-en">Mexico</a> joining the U.S. and other countries as part of the <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/fact-sheets/2011/november/outlines-trans-pacific-partnership-agreement">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) trade agreement would help maximize the strength of the North American market. Meanwhile, there are growing concerns over the secrecy surrounding the TPP. This includes fears that it would grant corporations more power and further put the sovereignty of member nations at risk. It could also be used as a <a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/06/using-tpp-to-renegotiate-and-expand.html">backdoor renegotiation of NAFTA</a> without officially having to open it back up. With the <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific-partnership/round-15-newzealand">15th round of talks</a> coming to a close in New Zealand, a final TPP deal could be reached before the end of 2013.<br /><br />In October, Ottawa hosted the <a href="http://northamericanforum.org/">North American Forum</a>. The annual get-together includes, “Canadian, Mexican and American thought leaders, whose purpose is to advance a shared vision of North America, and to contribute to improved relations among the three neighbors.” Much like other secretive gatherings, <a href="http://www.ipolitics.ca/2012/10/15/north-american-leaders-gather-in-otatwa-away-from-reporters-prying-eyes/">reporters were barred</a> from entering the Forum’s events. This year’s discussions centered around energy and North American economic competitiveness. Canadian Defence Minister Peter MacKay also delivered a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130309233719/http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-eng.asp?id=4460">keynote address</a> which focused on continental security issues. He highlighted the bilateral defence relations that the U.S. and Canada enjoy through NORAD. MacKay remarked on how, “Canada and Mexico are also becoming important strategic partners and stronger defence ties with Mexico are a priority.” He praised the first meeting of <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=15141">North American Defence Ministers</a> as a, “great opportunity for our three nations to identify ways to work together to address shared defence and security challenges.” The trilateral defence meeting which took place in March is part of the process of integrating Mexico into NORAD and establishing a North American security perimeter.<br /><br />While NAFTA partners pursue a trilateral approach with respect to different initiatives, the U.S. also has a separate bilateral border and regulatory agenda with Canada and Mexico. This is part of ongoing efforts to create a common economic and security perimeter. As the incremental path towards a North American Union continues, citizens from the U.S., Canada and Mexico are not being consulted, much less being given a choice in the matter even though the plan threatens the future sovereignty of each country.<br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/06/using-tpp-to-renegotiate-and-expand.html">Using the TPP to Renegotiate and Expand NAFTA</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/11/north-american-integration-and-ties.html">North American Integration and the Ties That Bind</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/04/nafta-partners-take-steps-to-boost_09.html">NAFTA Partners Take Steps to Boost Trilateral Relationship</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/03/north-american-leaders-summit-and.html">The North American Leaders Summit and Reviving Trilateral Integration</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

/></a></div><br />As part of the Beyond the Border initiative, the U.S. and Canada are strengthening cybersecurity cooperation. In a move that received little attention, both countries recently announced a joint cybersecurity action plan. Cyber threats know no national borders which has made the issue an important security concern. A fully integrated North American security perimeter would be entrusted with preventing and responding to any such attacks.<br /><br />One of the key priorities identified in the November 2011 <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/wh/us-canada-btb-action-plan.pdf">Beyond the Border Action Plan</a> is cybersecurity. The agreement lays the framework for enhancing U.S.-Canada, “bilateral cyber-security cooperation to better protect vital government and critical digital infrastructure and increase both countries' ability to respond jointly and effectively to cyber incidents. This will be achieved through joint projects and operational efforts, including joint briefings with the private sector and other stakeholders, and the enhancement of real-time information sharing between operation centres.” The deal will also work towards strengthening, “cooperation on international cyber-security and Internet governance issues to promote prosperity, enhance security and preserve openness in our networked world.” Merging cyber threat strategies would force Canada to further bring its security practices in line with American ones and under the reach of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). <a name='more'></a>   <br /><br />On October 26, Public Safety Canada and the DHS released a <a href="http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/prg/ns/cybr-scrty/_fl/ctn-pln-eng.pdf">Cybersecurity Action Plan</a> which represents a key commitment under the Beyond the Border agreement. A <a href="http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/media/nr/2012/nr20121026-1-eng.aspx">press release</a> explained that the specific goals include, “enhancing collaboration on cyber incident management between each country's cyber security operations centres, improving information sharing and engagement with the private sector, and continuing the ongoing collaboration between Canada and the U.S. on the promotion of cyber security awareness to the public.” The new joint action plan promotes a shared approach to cybersecurity and digital critical infrastructure protection. Building on these initiatives, both countries also seek to further integrate cyber capabilities into military command structures. <br /><br />Earlier this year, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta authorized the creation of the <a href="http://www.northcom.mil/Newsroom/tabid/3104/Article/3062/norad-usnorthcom-joint-cyber-center-stands-up.aspx">Joint Cyber Center</a> (JCC) run by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and U.S. Northern Command. The JCC will bring together personnel from the intelligence, operations and command control systems divisions. The aim is, “To better integrate cyber into the headquarters missions by improving situational awareness in the cyber domain, improving the defense of the commands’ networks and providing cyber consequence response and recovery support to civil authorities.” In June, <a href="http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120606/DEFREG02/306060010/Panetta-Green">DefenseNews reported</a> that Secretary Panetta, “approved a new organizational framework, a plan designed as a ‘first step’ towards standardized cyber operations.” This includes having a JCC at each geographic combatant command which is part of ongoing efforts to not only boost U.S., but continental cyber defense capabilities. In the near future, the U.S. and Canada could create a binational “cyber-NORAD” to protect North America from shared threats. <br /><br />The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) released an updated <a href="http://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/pdf_2011_09/20111004_110914-policy-cyberdefence.pdf">Policy on Cyber Defence</a> in June 2011. According to <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_78170.htm">NATO’s website</a>, “This revised policy offers a coordinated approach to cyber defence across the Alliance with a focus on preventing cyber attacks and building resilience.” It will act as the framework, “for how NATO will assist Allies, upon request, in their own cyber defence efforts, with the aim to optimise information sharing and situational awareness, collaboration and secure interoperability.” The new policy also, “sets the principles on NATO’s cyber defence cooperation with partner countries, international organisations, the private sector and academia.” In May of this year, the <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_87593.htm?mode=pressrelease">Chicago Summit Declaration</a>, “committed to provide the resources and complete the necessary reforms to bring all NATO bodies under centralised cyber protection.” It also pledged to, “further integrate cyber defence measures into Alliance structures and procedures.” U.S.-Canadian military cooperation also extends through NATO and this includes in the realm of cybersecurity. <br /><br />There are reports that President Barack Obama may be close to issuing a cybersecurity executive order as a means of bypassing Congress. Under the guise of cybersecurity, the U.S. and Canada have been individually pushing draconian legislation domestically which would grant government agencies sweeping new powers. The implications would be far reaching and pose a risk to privacy and civil liberties. Through the Beyond the Border initiative both countries are pursuing an integrated cybersecurity agenda. As they move forward and address common threats to North America, cyber and perimeter security will be further defined and dominated by U.S. interests.<br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/10/new-border-regime-is-taking-us-canada_9.html">Taking the U.S.-Canada Partnership to the Next Level</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/12/pretext-for-north-american-homeland_11.html">Pretext for a North American Homeland Security Perimeter</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/02/us-canada-strengthening-security.html">Strengthening U.S.-Canada Security Interests in North America</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/06/perimeter-security-and-integrated-north.html">Perimeter Security and an Integrated North American Command</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

European Union (EU) are working towards launching official negotiations on a deal that would further deepen their transatlantic trade partnership. <br /><br />According to a recent <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/17/us-eu-usa-trade-idUSBRE89G0KT20121017">Reuters</a> article, “Europe and the United States are set to launch trade talks early next year to deepen the world’s largest trading relationship.” It goes on to say that, “An expert group co-chaired by EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk will in December issue a report recommending pursuing talks.” An EU official explained that, “The report will recommend the negotiation of a comprehensive agreement between the United States and the European Union.” Last week, the European Parliament also <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20121019IPR54034/html/Free-trade-with-the-US-but-not-at-any-price-say-MEPs">approved a resolution</a> calling for talks on a possible trade deal with the U.S. to begin in 2013. The U.S. and EU have already made incremental strides with regards to economic integration. With renewed political support, momentum for a transatlantic trade accord is building. <a name='more'></a><br /><br />In 2007, U.S. President George W. Bush and German Chancellor Angela Merkel established the <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rt/eu/tec/index.htm">Transatlantic Economic Council</a> (TEC) to help eliminate trade barriers and harmonize standards. The move was seen as a step towards creating a single transatlantic market. Throughout the years, the TEC has advanced deep U.S.-EU integration. It has helped align policies in areas of  investment, accounting, import safety, supply chain security, automobile standards, renewable energy, as well as others. The TEC continues to guide and stimulate transatlantic economic convergence.<br /><br />At the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/28/joint-statement-us-eu-summit">U.S.-EU Summit</a> in November 2011, leaders from both sides directed the TEC to create a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/28/fact-sheet-high-level-working-group-jobs-and-growth">High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth</a>. This was viewed as another step forward to an eventual free trade deal. The Working Group was tasked with identifying, “policies and measures to increase U.S.-EU trade and investment to support mutually beneficial job creation, economic growth, and international competitiveness.” It was entrusted with examining options in areas of, “Conventional barriers to trade in goods, such as tariffs and tariff-rate quotas; Reduction, elimination, or prevention of barriers to trade in goods, services, and investment; Opportunities for enhancing the compatibility of regulations and standards; Reduction, elimination, or prevention of unnecessary ‘behind the border’ non-tariff barriers to trade in all categories; Enhanced cooperation for the development of rules and principles on global issues of common concern and also for the achievement of shared economic goals relating to third countries.” A U.S.-EU trade agreement could serve as a model for the rest of the world, setting common standards on regulations, tariffs and investment rules.<br /><br />In June, the U.S.-EU High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth issued an <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/reports-and-publications/2012/interim-report-eu-us-working-group">interim report</a> which endorsed beginning talks on a comprehensive trade deal. It outlined categories that a potential agreement should include such as tariffs, non-tariff barriers, regulatory issues, services, investment, procurement, intellectual property rights and rules. A <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/19/joint-us-eu-statement-high-level-working-group-jobs-and-growth">Joint U.S.-EU Statement</a> urged, “the Group to complete its work as quickly as possible, including consultations with public and private stakeholders, in accordance with the respective processes of both sides, with the goal of reaching a recommendation to Leaders later this year on a decision as to the negotiations.” At a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/20/remarks-president-obama-press-conference-after-g20-summit">press conference</a> following the G20 Summit in Mexico, President Barack Obama also acknowledged that, “the United States and the European Union agreed to take the next step in our work towards the possible launching of negotiations on an agreement to strengthen our already very deep trade and investment partnership.” An official announcement is expected sometime after the U.S. election and if trade talks begin early next year, a deal could be signed before the end of 2014.<br /><br />The U.S.-EU partnership remains the foundation for an international economic order. Regardless of whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney wins the upcoming election, it appears as if U.S.-EU trade negotiations will become a priority. More globalization is not the solution to our financial woes. Such an agreement would serve to further erode U.S. sovereignty and economic freedom. If you factor in that the EU already has a trade deal with Mexico and is close to signing one with Canada, combined with a future agreement with the U.S., you then have the basis for a NAFTA-EU free trade zone. This would be an important step in advancing the goal of creating a Transatlantic Union. <br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/08/growing-opposition-to-canada-eu-trade.html">Growing Opposition to the Canada-EU Trade Agreement</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2010/03/advancing-transatlantic-agenda.html">Advancing the Transatlantic Agenda</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/01/from-nafta-to-ceta-canada-eu-deep.html">From NAFTA to CETA: Canada-EU Deep Economic Integration</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/08/flashback-spreading-naftas-love-across.html">Spreading NAFTA's Love Across the Atlantic</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

significant step forward in U.S.-Canada cooperation since NAFTA. Dual action plans are further transforming trade, regulatory and security relations between both countries. Over the next few years, various cross-border initiatives will be rolled out, with some beginning as pilot programs. The U.S. and Canada have laid the framework for a new border regime which is taking their partnership to the next level and pushing the continent closer to a fully integrated North American security perimeter.<br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security and Canada Border Services Agency recently announced the <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/newsroom/news_releases/national/09282012.xml">Phase I pilot of the Entry/Exit program</a> which is part of the <a href="http://photos.state.gov/libraries/canada/303578/pdfs/us-canada-btb_action_plan.pdf">Beyond the Border</a> action plan. It will include collecting and exchanging biographic information of third-country nationals, permanent residents of Canada, and lawful permanent residents of the U.S. at four selected land border ports of entry. A <a href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/media/facts-faits/117-eng.html">fact sheet</a> stressed how this, “is an important step as both countries move towards a coordinated entry/exit system that will strengthen border and immigration programs, support law enforcement, and accelerate the legitimate flow of people and goods into Canada and the United States and across our common border.” The Canadian government is also advancing plans to use <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/releases/2012/2012-02-16.asp">biometrics for immigration and border security</a> that would bring them in line with the U.S. and other countries. The perimeter security agreement called for implementing, “systematic and automated biographic information-sharing capability by 2013 and biometric information-sharing capability by 2014.” A North American biometric identification system could be used to restrict, track and trace our movements. <a name='more'></a> <br /><br />On October 4, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Transport Canada officials <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/press/releases/2012/10/04/tsa-pre%E2%9C%93%E2%84%A2-expands-canadian-nexus-members">announced</a> the extension of the expedited screening initiative, <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/tsa-pre%E2%9C%93%E2%84%A2">TSA Pre✓™</a> which will now include lanes for Canadian NEXUS members at 27 participating U.S. airports. Canadian Minister of State For Transport Steven Fletcher explained that, “The Government of Canada and the United States are delivering on commitments to include Canadian NEXUS members in designated TSA Pre✓™ lanes as part of the Beyond the Border Action Plan.” He went on to say, “This will mean smarter and faster air travel for Canadian NEXUS members traveling within the U.S., while maintaining a high level of aviation security.” TSA Administrator John Pistole acknowledged that, “The inclusion of Canadian NEXUS members in TSA Pre✓™ is an important step in further harmonizing the security screening process between the U.S. and Canada.” Under <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/trusted_traveler/nexus_prog/nexus.xml">NEXUS</a>, pre-screened travelers are granted expedited access across the border, by air, land or sea. As part of the perimeter security deal, both countries are expanding and integrating trusted traveler programs.<br /><br />The Next-Generation pilot project which would permit <a href="http://www.embassymag.ca/news/2012/09/19/plan-to-have-us-agents-on-canadian-soil-on-hold-government/42409?absolute=1">U.S. agents on Canadian soil is on hold</a> while legal issues are being resolved. The security perimeter agreement stated that both countries would, “create integrated teams in areas such as intelligence and criminal investigations, and an intelligence-led uniformed presence between ports of entry.” The plan which is a land-based version of the <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ibet-eipf/shiprider-eng.htm">Shiprider</a> program was scheduled to be deployed this summer. Allowing U.S. agents to cross the border and pursue suspects into Canada poses a threat to sovereignty and could infringe on personal privacy laws. The pilot project is part of the process of acclimating U.S. policing activities in Canada and could later be expanded.<br /><br />Last month, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency established a <a href="http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/meat-and-poultry-products/program-changes/update-beyond-the-border/eng/1348789386214/1348789475806">pre-clearance initiative pilot project on import re-inspection activities for fresh meat</a>. This is tied to the Beyond the Border deal and is aimed at streamlining meat inspections at the U.S.-Canada border. Just as the joint program was being rolled out, XL Foods in Alberta, Canada announced a massive <a href="http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/consumer-centre/food-safety-investigations/xl-foods/eng/1347937722467/1347937818275">recall of meat products</a> due to E. coli contamination. This came on the heels of a letter from the <a href="http://documents.foodandwaterwatch.org/doc/BTBVilsackLetterwithImagesSept182012Press_copy.pdf">Safe Food Coalition</a> to the USDA citing concerns that food safety could be compromised and requesting that the border inspection pilot be halted. Some of the potential tainted meat could have been shipped to at least eight U.S. states. In a <a href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/pressreleases/wheres-the-recall-tainted-canadian-beef-presently-in-the-u-s-deregulation-plans-underway-would-bring-more/">press statement</a>, the Executive Director of Food & Water Watch, Wenonah Hauter pointed out that, “the Obama Administration and the Harper Government in Canada have been plotting to eliminate the very border inspection program that tipped off authorities that there was a major problem brewing with the products originating from the XL plant.” Plans to further deregulate food safety inspections could lead to more trouble in the future.<br /><br />In September, Transport Canada and the United States Coast Guard <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/mediaroom/releases-2012-h092e-6850.htm">launched a pilot project</a> that will include joint Port State Control inspections of non-Canadian and non-U.S. flagged vessels in the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway. Rear Adm. Mike Parks, Commander of the U.S. Coast Guard Ninth District described how, “This initiative is in keeping with President Obama's and Prime Minister Harper's Beyond the Border Perimeter Security Initiative protecting the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway region, which provides common access to the heart of North America. Our goal is to make vessel inspections more efficient and facilitate American and Canadian business on both sides of our shared border.” The program is outlined in the <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/mediaroom/releases-2012-h092e-6850.htm">Regulatory Cooperation Council</a> action plan and establishes a, “safety and security framework for the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway that will align the two countries’ regulatory requirements. This pilot project will look for efficiencies in order to reduce duplicate inspections and impediments to trade.” When completed, recommendations will be made on whether to form a permanent binational foreign vessel inspection program.<br /><br />NAFTA partners, in conjunction with multinational corporations and influential think tanks are pushing for deeper North American integration. As far as the upcoming U.S. election goes, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are both committed globalists and have no intentions of upholding the constitution or protecting what is left of American sovereignty. The notion of real choice is now even more of an illusion. Minus the Democrat and Republican rhetoric, it’s essentially the same policies, same agenda, and the same team. It doesn’t matter who wins the presidency, the path towards a North American Union will continue.<br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/07/paving-way-for-us-canada-economic-and.html">Paving the Way for a U.S.-Canada Economic and Security Perimeter</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/06/laying-foundation-for-north-american.html">Laying the Foundation for a North American Security Perimeter</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/05/us-and-canada-quietly-implementing.html">Implementing Beyond the Border Perimeter Security Initiatives</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/03/perimeter-approach-to-security-and.html">A Perimeter Approach to Security and the Transformation of the U.S.-Canada Border</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

Meanwhile, there is growing opposition to the agreement as the whole process has lacked openness, transparency and any public consultations. In Canada, there are concerns over the threat it poses to local democracy. This includes fears of deregulation and privatization, as well the expansion of corporate investor rights. There are also warnings that the deal could be used as a backdoor means to implement ACTA which was rejected by the European Parliament in July.<br /><br />As the Canada-European Union (EU) <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/eu-ue/negotiations-negociations.aspx?lang=eng&view=d">Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement</a> (CETA) talks near their end, the Council of Canadians continue to voice their opposition to the deal. While I don’t agree with their position on some different issues, they have been championing the fight against CETA. In an effort to counter misleading statements made by the Conservative government regarding the trade pact, they have released the report, the <a href="http://www.canadians.org/trade/issues/EU/ceta-deception/index.html">CETA Deception</a>. Trade campaigner, <a href="http://canadians.org/blog/?p=16152">Stuart Trew</a> explained how this is an effort to, “challenge the government’s reassurances that its EU trade deal will not affect public health or environmental regulations, will not allow foreign corporations to challenge public policy, will not undermine public services or municipal democracy, will not increase drug prices or hurt Canada’s supports for arts and culture. In each case, the government’s position is either misleading or demonstrably false.” As a result of the <a href="http://www.canadians.org/action/2011/CETA-resolution.html">threat CETA poses to local sovereignty</a>, a growing number of Canadian municipalities have passed resolutions seeking more information and a greater say in negotiations with some also requesting to be excluded from the agreement. <a name='more'></a><br /><br />In her recent visit to Canada, German Chancellor Angela Merkel <a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/merkel-pledges-support-for-canada-eu-free-trade-pact-1.916629">pledged support for the Canada-EU free-trade pact</a> and promised to see to it that talks come to a speedy conclusion. The endorsement was seen as a much needed boost for Prime Minister Stephen Harper who is eager to get a deal signed before the end of the year. The Conservative government maintains that deeper trade with the EU will create jobs, economic growth and long-term prosperity. They have also tried to convince the public that CETA has been one of the most transparent trade negotiations in Canadian history. In an article for <a href="http://www.ipolitics.ca/2012/07/24/stuart-trew-ceta-will-constrain-options-for-governments-at-all-levels/">iPolitics</a>, Stuart Trew stressed that, “If CETA and agreements like it are supposed to be 21st century or ‘next-generation’ free trade deals, they should be negotiated in 21st century ways ― openly, transparently, and with broad public input. Failure to do so in the ACTA negotiations led to that agreement’s demise in the European Parliament. The same fate could easily await CETA on both sides of the Atlantic.”<br /><br />Last month, after mounting public pressure, the European Parliament <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20120703IPR48247/html/European-Parliament-rejects-ACTA">rejected</a> the <a href="http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2012/01/20120125acta.pdf">Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement</a> (ACTA). The vote was the result of, “unprecedented direct lobbying by thousands of EU citizens who called on it to reject ACTA, in street demonstrations, e-mails to MEPs and calls to their offices. Parliament also received a petition, signed by 2.8 million citizens worldwide.” The U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand, as well as other countries have also signed on to ACTA, but have yet to ratify the deal. ACTA poses a serious risk to internet freedom and privacy. It would also give an unfair advantage to patented medicines and limit access to affordable generic options. Academic researcher and law professor <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6578/125/">Michael Geist warned</a> that, “In the coming weeks and months, we can expect new efforts to revive the agreement within Europe and to find alternative means to implement its provisions.” It now appears that EU negotiators are trying to use CETA to sneak in ACTA. <br /><br />Just days after ACTA was defeated, Michael Geist <a href="http://www.thestar.com/business/article/1223118--controversial-copyright-rules-threaten-canada-european-trade-deal">reported</a> that leaked documents show the, “EU plans to use the Canada-EU Trade Agreement (CETA), which is nearing its final stages of negotiation, as a backdoor mechanism to implement the ACTA provisions.” He noted that, “The European Commission strategy appears to be to use CETA as the new ACTA, burying its provisions in a broader Canadian trade agreement with the hope that the European Parliament accepts the same provisions it just rejected with the ACTA framework.” After initially refusing to comment on the leak, the European Commission issued the statement, <a href="http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=826">CETA is not ACTA</a> in which they claimed that, “The accusations are unfounded since they rely on outdated and incomplete information.” In a recent <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6609/125/">update</a>, Geist reaffirmed that the, “concerns that CETA may replicate ACTA appear to be very real despite the denials from the European Commission.” This whole issue has caused an uproar across Europe and in Canada and has brought much needed attention to CETA. <br /><br />In their article, <a href="http://canadians.org/blog/?p=16212">A trade deal that sets a bad precedent</a>, Stuart Trew and Blair Redlin emphasized other CETA dangers besides ACTA which may threaten European policy and interests. They pointed out that CETA will be the first EU-wide investor-rights treaty covering all member states. Trew and Redlin posed the question, “What difference would a new treaty with Canada make? It is important to keep in mind the deep integration of the North American economy. The same U.S. firms that have taken Canada before investor-state panels under the North American free-trade agreement (NAFTA) 17 times will be able to challenge EU policy through their Canadian investments.” As far as NAFTA rules go, any rights granted to EU corporations as part of CETA would also apply to North American companies. CETA is being used to bridge the NAFTA and EU trade models. Ultimately, what happens with CETA will affect how the U.S. and EU move forward with their own future free trade plans. <br /><br />According to <a href="http://scfp.ca/updir/Shrybman_CETA_opinion_E.pdf">legal analysis</a> by international trade and public interest lawyer, Steven Shrybman, CETA would expand NAFTA investor rights and protections. He acknowledged that, “With CETA, Canada is proposing to accord EU investors and services providers far more expansive rights than those accorded (to) their U.S. and Mexican counterparts. Canada would therefore be required to provide this ‘most-favoured’ treatment to its NAFTA partners, even though neither is making reciprocal commitments.” Shrybman also described how the trade deal will give European corporations new rights at the expense of provincial powers. He cautioned that, “CETA represents a dramatic expansion of the application of international rules to spheres of provincial and local governance.” He went on to say, “policy and regulatory options of provincial, territorial and municipal governments will be curtailed to a much greater extent than has been the case under these earlier free trade agreements.” Modeled in the same fashion as NAFTA’s Chapter 11, the investor-state dispute process in CETA would give EU corporations the right to challenge government policies that restrict their profits.<br /><br />As negotiations enter their final stretch, it is imperative to get the word out on how CETA could further jeopardize our political and economic sovereignty. A NAFTA-style free trade agreement with Europe that gives corporations further powers to influence Canadian laws would be dangerous and destructive. Considering the deepening economic crisis in Europe and the real possibility that the Eurozone could break up, it is also the wrong time for Canada to be entering into this trade deal with the EU.<br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2010/03/advancing-transatlantic-agenda.html">Advancing the Transatlantic Agenda</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/06/using-tpp-to-renegotiate-and-expand.html">Using the TPP to Renegotiate and Expand NAFTA</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/01/from-nafta-to-ceta-canada-eu-deep.html">From NAFTA to CETA: Canada-EU Deep Economic Integration</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/08/flashback-spreading-naftas-love-across.html">Spreading NAFTA's Love Across the Atlantic</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

It has been reported that the proposed trade deal will far exceed NAFTA. Some see this as an opportunity to possibly update the 15 year-old accord. Stephen Harper is busy telling Canadians that only a Conservative majority government will be able to bring confidence back and stabilize the economy. That is why I find it a little strange that this has not become a pillar of the Conservatives economic platform. Harper has decided not to release the full text of the draft proposal until after the election on October 14. The reality is that such an agreement with the EU will be no different than NAFTA in the sense that it will be used to further advance corporate interests.<br /><br />For the past several months, Canadian officials have been hard at work negotiating with EU representatives. They have compiled a detailed study that will be unveiled after the election. Talks could begin as early as October 17 at a summit in Montreal , with formal negotiations set to begin in 2009. Just as the case with the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) labour, citizen groups and the public at large have been excluded from any discussions. Many support this trade initiative because they wish to lessen Canada’s dependency on the American economy. This agreement has a better chance of succeeding if Harper is re-elected Prime Minister. There still remains much secrecy surrounding trade talks with the EU, and up to this point, Harper appears to be reluctant to make this an election issue. <a name='more'></a><br /><br />French and current rotating EU president Nicolas Sarkozy has said that he wishes economic integration with Canada to be part of his lasting legacy. Europe sees Canada’s energy resources as a possible solution to easing their dependency on Russian oil and gas. In a commentary that appeared in the Globe and Mail, Alan Alexandroff, co-author of the C.D. Howe Institute paper titled Still Amigos, writes, “If the EU and Canada can forge an accord that covers services, government procurement and skilled labour that could well set the table for reviving the original NAFTA.” He went on to say, “If the EU and Canada join hands, the U.S. and Mexico will be eager to join the party.”  Some believe that such an agreement will further advance North American integration while spreading NAFTA to Europe. A Canada-EU trade deal could be used as the model for future bilateral accords and as a way to further renew U.S.-EU relations.<br /><br />There are calls to further deepen the U.S.-EU partnership with a new sense of multilateralism in areas of trade, climate change, and fighting terrorism. In April of 2007, it was announced with very little fanfare that the U.S.-EU had reached a deal on a new Trans-Atlantic Economic Partnership. They agreed to set up an economic council and further boost trade and investment by harmonizing services, business takeovers, and intellectual property. They also agreed to continue working towards eliminating non-tariff barriers to trade, which could eventually lead to a U.S.-EU single market.<br /><br />Economic integration was a first step in the creation of the EU, and a similar stealth approach is being used to advance a North American Union. EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso recently said in a speech, “We have to make room at the top table for others, because that is the only way we can consolidate and strengthen a stable, multilateral world, governed by internationally agreed rules.” He also stated, “the time has come to start thinking of an Atlantic Agenda for Globalisation.” With the further erosion of national sovereignty and continued economic, social, cultural and environmental integration, we are on an undeniable path towards world government.<br /><br />With the collapse of the WTO talks, more bilateral trade agreements will be used in advancing the New World Order’s agenda. The global elite, pushing for world government, are using the current financial turmoil to acquire more wealth and power. Economic uncertainty could also be used to usher in a North American Union with its own currency.

This includes efforts to modernize and expand infrastructure at key land ports. In a move that went largely unnoticed, both countries also recently agreed on a statement of privacy principles that will guide information sharing across the border. Meanwhile, a separate joint initiative has been announced which addresses energy and environmental issues.<br /><br />President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Stephen Harper launched the <a href="http://www.climatechange.gc.ca/dialogue/default.asp?lang=En&n=E47AAD1C-1">U.S.-Canada Clean Energy Dialogue</a> (CED) in 2009 to promote new ways to reduce greenhouse gases and combat climate change. The <a href="http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/CED%20Action%20Plan%20II_June%2012%202012.pdf">CED Action Plan II</a> released last month, outlines the next phase of activities both countries will undertake. This includes continued work on carbon capture and storage, as well as integrating the electricity grid. In a <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=714D9AAE-1&news=B55159A3-4F9B-4AA9-B3B9-F0F408C99D04">press statement</a>, Canada’s Minister of the Environment Peter Kent explained that the CED, “strengthens our efforts to collaborate on innovative clean energy solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” He also commented on how "It is our hope that the transformation of our economies and our joint work will identify clean energy solutions that will contribute to making sustainable energy a reality for all." Whether real or exaggerated, environmental issues are also advancing North American integration. If you look at some of the words being used and the goals being pushed, they are tied to Agenda 21. Under the guise of protecting the environment, many solutions being offered are in the form of more taxes and control over our lives. <a name='more'></a><br /><br />In June, Canada reached an agreement with the State of Michigan to build a second bridge between Windsor and Detroit which is one of North America’s busiest land crossings. A <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=4864">press release</a> described how, “The new Detroit River International Crossing will facilitate the movement of people and goods between Canada and the U.S. by ensuring that there is sufficient border crossing capacity to handle projected growth in cross-border trade and traffic.” It goes on to say that the, “announcement demonstrates that the Government of Canada is working to advance the goals of the <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/bbg-tpf/perimeter-security-and-economic-competitiveness-action-plan">Action Plan on Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness</a>.” During a <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=4866">speech</a>, Prime Minister Stephen Harper called the new bridge, “an investment in the future of the North American economy, of North American trade and of North American manufacturing.” With the existing Ambassador Bridge being privately owned, motivation for the project is largely based on being able to further control border trade and traffic in the region. It is also part of the necessary transportation infrastructure needed for a trade corridor that would span from Windsor, Ontario to southern Mexico.<br /><br />The U.S. and Canada recently issued a <a href="http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/prg/le/_fl/bynd-brdr-eng.pdf">Statement of Privacy Principles</a> that will shape information sharing arrangements under the perimeter security deal. The charter covers areas such as oversight, accountability, redress, retention, data quality and information security. Attorney General Eric Holder acknowledged in a Department of Justice <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/June/12-ag-828.html">news release</a> that “These privacy principles reflect the shared commitment of the United States and Canada to implement our Beyond the Border Action Plan.” The Freedom of Information and Privacy Association <a href="http://fipa.bc.ca/home/news/320">warned</a> that, “What the government just announced will certainly provide more access to Canadians personal information to the U.S. and other governments.” The <a href="http://ccla.org/2012/06/29/new-privacy-principles-released-between-canada-us-for-security-perimeter/">Canadian Civil Liberties Association</a> have also voiced concerns on privacy safeguard provisions that were not included which, “may permit the lowest standard between the two countries to prevail.” Ever since the perimeter security action plan was first unveiled in December 2011, there have been fears associated with personal data collected and exchanged at the border. This latest announcement has done little to ease these worries with respect to privacy rights and civil liberties.<br /><br />As part of their commitment under the Beyond the Border agreement, both countries have also announced the establishment of <a href="http://canada.usembassy.gov/news-events/2012-news-and-events/june-2012/13-june-2012-establishing-joint-port-operations-committees-at-eight-canadian-airports.html">Joint Port Operations Committees</a> at eight Canadian airports that offer U.S. pre-clearance service. The move is designed to, “help facilitate legitimate cross-border trade and travel and promote collaboration on overall port management.” In June, the <a href="http://canada.usembassy.gov/news-events/2012-news-and-events/june-2012/21-june-2012-beyond-the-border-steering-committee.html">Beyond the Border Executive Steering Committee</a> met to oversee progress on the implementation of the action plan. They announced that in the interest of transparency and accountability, a joint public report will be issued in December. Public Safety Minister Vic Toews also recently gave an <a href="http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/media/nr/2012/nr20120716-eng.aspx">update</a> on other aspects of the perimeter security deal. He stated, “We are making great progress. We have, for example, added NEXUS lanes, made air cargo screening programs mutually recognizable and installed new passenger screening machines to end duplicate screening in Canadian airports.” Toews added, “More work continues every day to fully implement this new shared vision that represents the most significant step forward in Canada-U.S. cooperation since the North American Free Trade Agreement." <br /><br />Despite some minor setbacks with regards to bilateral relations, Canada has moved closer to its American partner under Prime Minister Harper. The Beyond the Border deal provides the essential framework for U.S.-Canada integration with the action plan being incrementally implemented. This piece by piece approach has allowed many different initiatives to go unnoticed and fly under the radar. Some of these individual steps may seem insignificant, but combined together they are further merging economic and security ties between both countries. This is paving the way for a North American security perimeter which would mean sacrificing what is left of our sovereignty and independence.<br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/06/using-tpp-to-renegotiate-and-expand.html">Using the TPP to Renegotiate and Expand NAFTA</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/06/laying-foundation-for-north-american.html">Laying the Foundation for a North American Security Perimeter</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/05/us-and-canada-quietly-implementing.html">Implementing Beyond the Border Perimeter Security Initiatives</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/03/perimeter-approach-to-security-and.html">The Transformation of the U.S.-Canada Border</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

region. Such a deal would surpass NAFTA in size and scope. The U.S. led talks which have been criticized for their secretive nature, could be used to update aspects of existing trade pacts among member nations. This would  provide the perfect opportunity for a backdoor renegotiation of NAFTA without officially having to open it back up.<br /><br />After expressing interest in joining trade talks back in November 2011, NAFTA partners have been invited to join the U.S. backed <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/fact-sheets/2011/november/outlines-trans-pacific-partnership-agreement">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) which also includes Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk welcomed both <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/2012/june/ustr-mexico-new-tpp-partner">Mexico</a> and <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/2012/june/ustr-kirk-welcomes-canada-as-new-tpp-partner">Canada</a> into the TPP fold. He noted that, “Mexico has assured the United States that it is prepared to conclude a high-standard agreement that will include issues that were not covered in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).” He added, “Inviting Canada to join the TPP negotiations presents a unique opportunity for the United States to build upon this already dynamic trading relationship. Through TPP, we are bringing the relationship with our largest trading partner into the 21st century.” A <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/19/joint-statement-united-states-and-canada">joint statement</a> by the U.S. and Canada acknowledged that, “The TPP presents an opportunity to conclude a high standard agreement that will build on the commitments of NAFTA.” <a name='more'></a><br /><br />The <a href="http://canadians.org/media/trade/2012/19-Jun-12.html">Council of Canadians</a> who continue to be vocal opponents of NAFTA and other trade deals that follow the same flawed template, are strongly against Canada’s entry into the TPP. Its national chairperson, Maude Barlow warned that this, “could force Canada to change its drug policies, its copyright policies, its environmental and public health rules – all without going through the normal parliamentary process.” The organization cautioned how, “TPP negotiations could mean up-front concessions in a number of areas, including intellectual property rights, where the U.S. is making considerable demands on TPP member countries that will undermine access to essential medicines so that its multinational drug firms can increase profits.” They also emphasized that, “Supply management, which guarantees fair wages and stable prices for farmers in non-exporting sectors, is too valuable to Canada to sacrifice on a negotiating table.” Others have  pointed out that it is important as a buy-local program, as well as key to Canada’s food security and food sovereignty. The Council of Canadians maintains that, “the TPP is by and large a NAFTA renegotiation but on U.S. President Obama’s terms.” <br /><br />Not surprisingly, the <a href="http://www.ceocouncil.ca/news-item/ceos-applaud-historic-commitment-to-stronger-asia-pacific-trade-and-investment-ties">Canadian Council of Chief Executives</a>, an organization that lobbies the government on behalf of  the country’s largest corporations, welcomed the announcement that Canada has been invited to join the TPP talks. Its President and CEO John Manley stated that, “By signing on to the TPP, the federal government has taken an historic leap toward securing Canada’s long-term strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region.” The U.S. Chamber of Commerce have also <a href="http://www.uschamber.com/press/releases/2012/june/us-chamber-applauds-canada%E2%80%99s-entry-trans-pacific-partnership-negotiations">applauded</a> Canada and Mexico’s entry into the TPP. Its President and CEO Thomas Donohue argued that, “negotiating the TPP together is an excellent strategic decision for North America.” Back in January, the <a href="http://www.as-coa.org/articles/submission-comments-office-united-states-trade-representative-canadas-expression-interest">Council of the Americas</a> explained how, “it makes little sense for the United States to enter into potentially significant trade arrangements with countries in the Pacific region without our NAFTA partners.” They view the TPP as a “promising vehicle to support the updating of our bilateral and trilateral trading relationships within North America to the high standards of twenty-first century free-trade agreements.” <br /><br />In his article, <a href="http://www.ipolitics.ca/2012/06/19/peter-clark-will-invitation-to-join-tpp-talks-lead-to-nafta-2-0/">Will invitation to join TPP talks lead to NAFTA 2.0?</a>, Peter Clark one of Canada’s leading international trade strategists concluded that, “A successful TPP would allow NAFTA to essentially be re-opened without the optics of it actually being re-opened.” He went on to say, “The business leaders in all three NAFTA countries, as strong supporters of TPP invitations to Canada and Mexico, understand that after nearly 20 years, modernization of NAFTA is needed. For rules of origin, supply chain management and manufacturing integration.” Clark stressed that, “All Canadians should be clear about this – TPP is the negotiation of NAFTA 2.0 and it could have major implications for Canada-USA trade relations.” Meanwhile, both countries are implementing the <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/bbg-tpf/perimeter-security-and-economic-competitiveness-action-plan">Beyond the Border Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness Action Plan</a> which has been described as the most significant steps forward in U.S.-Canada cooperation since NAFTA. <a href="http://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&id=9003&pubType=hi_opeds">Christopher Sands</a> of the Hudson Institute observed how, “The TPP negotiating agenda is at once similar to the bilateral agenda that Canada and the United States are pursuing, and also more ambitious and multilateral.”<br /><br />In May, the TPP held its <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/2012/may/trans-pacific-partnership-tpp-talks-advance-texas">twelfth round of negotiations</a> with the next set of talks scheduled to take place in San Diego, California from July 2-10.  So far, there has been a real lack of transparency, but what is clear is that the TPP seeks to go beyond other trade agreements. According to a <a href="http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2012/06/controversial-trade-pact-text-leaked-shows-us-trade-officials-have-agreed-to-terms-that-undermine-ob.html">leaked text by Public Citizen</a>, it would expand on the investor privileges found in NAFTA, granting corporations more power and further threatening the sovereign rights of member nations. In the meantime, the U.S. continues to spearhead TPP negotiations as a way of countering growing Chinese influence. The door is open for other countries to join which is why it is considered to be a stepping stone to a larger free trade area of the Asia-Pacific and an important part of the international corporate globalization agenda. <br /><br />Trade deals such as NAFTA and now the TPP are being used to smuggle through a new set of transnational corporate rights, trapping nations in a web of treaties that further trump their own laws. All too often, these agreements fail to deliver on the promise of prosperity and only serve to accelerate the path towards economic enslavement. Globalization has meant sacrificing self-sufficiency and sovereignty for foreign dependency which is a sure path to world government. <br /><br />Related Articles By Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/11/canada-and-mexico-to-join-us-in-nafta.html">Canada and Mexico to Join U.S. in NAFTA of the Pacific</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2009/11/building-blocks-towards-asia-pacific.html">Building Blocks Towards an Asia-Pacific Union</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/04/nafta-partners-take-steps-to-boost_09.html">NAFTA Partners Take Steps to Boost Trilateral Relationship</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2010/10/us-economic-political-and-military.html">U.S. Economic, Political and Military Expansion in Asia-Pacific</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

Gabriel<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7CYSylMnEwQ/T9UMGpBpBkI/AAAAAAAAAZM/pyGH0iwjyLI/s1600/NASecurity_perimeter.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px;

alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5752517407267161666" /></a><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently unveiled a northern border strategy which seeks to address security concerns, while at the same time facilitating the flow of lawful travel and trade. The new plan promotes enhanced shared intelligence and joint law enforcement integration with Canada. It further builds on initiatives included in the Beyond the Border agreement and is part of ongoing efforts to lay the foundation for a North American security perimeter.<br /><br />On June 5, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano announced the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/policy/dhs-northern-border-strategy.pdf">Northern Border Strategy</a> (NBS) aimed at deterring and preventing terrorism, smuggling, trafficking and illegal immigration. In a <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/ynews/releases/20120605-napolitano-northern-border-strategy.shtm">press release</a> she explained how the new plan, “provides a unifying framework for the Department’s work focused on enhancing the security and resiliency along our northern border while expediting legitimate travel and trade with Canada.” In order to accomplish these objectives, the NBS will work to, “improve information sharing and analysis within DHS, as well as with key partners. The Department will also enhance coordination of U.S.-Canada joint interdictions and investigations, deploy technologies to aid joint security efforts along the border, and continue to update infrastructure.” The NBS parallels the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/national_northern_border_counternarcotics_strategy_.pdf">National Northern Border Counternarcotics Strategy</a> issued in January. It also supports goals outlined in the U.S.-Canada <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/wh/us-canada-btb-action-plan.pdf">Beyond the Border</a> action plan which focuses on addressing security threats early, facilitating trade, economic growth and jobs, integrating cross-border law enforcement, as well as improving infrastructure and cyber-security. <a name='more'></a><br /><br />Another facet of the perimeter security deal is the U.S.-Canada <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/us-canada_rcc_joint_action_plan3.pdf">Regulatory Cooperation Council</a> (RCC) action plan. It seeks greater regulatory alignment in the areas of agriculture and food, transportation, the environment, health, along with consumer products. In January, government representatives, as well as industry officials held <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/eng/feature.asp?mode=preview&pageId=407">regulatory meetings</a> in Washington. The RCC has now published <a href="http://www.trade.gov/rcc/">work plans</a> in some of the specific areas noting that the rest of them will be posted when they are finalized. The whole process of regulatory reform has received more attention with President Barack Obama signing an Executive Order in early May, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/01/executive-order-promoting-international-regulatory-cooperation">Promoting International Regulatory Cooperation</a>. This will build on the work already underway by the RCC. In Canada, there are fears that deepening regulatory integration with the U.S. could weaken and erode any independent regulatory capacity, thus threatening its sovereignty. Further harmonization could result in Canada losing control over its ability to regulate food safety. This could also lead to a race to the bottom with respect to other regulatory standards. <br /><br />As part of the Beyond the Border agreement, the U.S. and Canada are also working towards an integrated cargo security strategy. In May, they agreed to a new <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/mediaroom/releases-2012-h053e-6724.htm">mutual recognition initiative</a> whereby, “cargo shipped on passenger aircraft will now be screened only once for transportation security reasons, at the point of origin and will not need to be rescreened prior to upload on an aircraft in the other country.” Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy James Nealon proclaimed that, “Through this program, we will be able to move goods between U.S. and Canada faster, more efficiently, and most securely.” A <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/mediaroom/backgrounders-menu-air-cargo-6725.htm">Transport Canada backgrounder</a> acknowledged that, “Air cargo is just the start. Canada and the U.S. are working together to strengthen co-ordination, co-operation and timely decision-making at the border for cargo shipped by sea or land with a view to increasing two-way trade, and reducing travel and commercial disruptions. When the Action Plan is fully implemented, the principle of ‘screened once, accepted twice’ is intended to apply to all modes of shipping cargo.” In order to keep trade flowing across the northern border, Canada is being pressured to further take on U.S. security priorities. <br /><br />Last month, there were a series of U.S.-Canada joint consultation sessions with stakeholders regarding <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/ynews/releases/20120514-us-canada-cross-border-issues.shtm">facilitating cross-border business</a>. In addition, Public Safety Canada and the DHS issued the document, <a href="http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/prg/ns/ci/_fl/btdm-eng.pdf">Considerations for United States-Canada Border Traffic Disruption Management</a>. According to a <a href="http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/media/nr/2012/nr20120514-eng.aspx">news release</a> it, “fulfils one of the first commitments under the Canada-U.S. Action Plan on Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness.” The joint emergency guide, “outlines best practices and identifies critical issues to consider when developing or updating traffic management plans to ensure they are tailored to address regional requirements and individual border crossings.” Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews stated that, “This plan is the result of close collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, including government officials from the local, state, and provincial/territorial level, to manage the flow of traffic near the border during a disruption.” He went on to say, “Implementation of this guide will help maintain economic stability and ensure that priority traffic moves freely towards and away from the secure Canada-U.S. border during times of crisis.”<br /><br />Through various initiatives, NAFTA partners are laying the foundation for a fully integrated North American security perimeter. In the advent of a terrorist attack, disaster or any other perceived threat to the continent, the U.S. could then execute control over the security perimeter. The global elite are not ones to let a serious crisis go to waste. Such a scenario would also provide the perfect cover needed to officially usher in a North American Union.<br /><br />Related Articles By Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/05/us-and-canada-quietly-implementing.html">Implementing Beyond the Border Perimeter Security Initiatives</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/02/counter-terrorism-and-northern-border.html">Northern Border Drug Strategy Tied to Perimeter Security Deal</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/12/pretext-for-north-american-homeland_11.html">The Pretext for a North American Homeland Security Perimeter</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/09/us-canada-perimeter-security-and.html">U.S.-Canada Perimeter Security and the Consolidation of North America</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

/></a><br />Through the Beyond the Border agreement released in December 2011, the U.S. and Canada are implementing initiatives that are working towards establishing a North American security perimeter. This includes expanding trusted traveler programs, as well as enhancing integrated law enforcement and information sharing cooperation which has raised many privacy concerns that have yet to be properly addressed. <br /><br />There are questions surrounding the Conservative government’s <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=5524772&Language=E&Mode=1">Bill C-38, the Budget Implementation Act</a> that also contains changes related to the U.S.-Canada <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/bbg-tpf/perimeter-security-and-economic-competitiveness-action-plan">Beyond the Border</a> action plan. This includes ratifying and making the <a href="http://205.193.86.86/ibet-eipf/shiprider-eng.htm">Shiprider</a> a legal and permanent program which will require amending the Criminal Code, along with the RCMP and Customs Act. The joint initiative officially known as the Integrated Cross-Border Maritime Law Enforcement Operations first began as a pilot project. It allows RCMP and U.S. Coast Guard officers to operate vessels together and pursue criminals in the waters of both countries. The Council of Canadians <a href="http://canadians.org/blog/?p=14891">reported</a> that the NDP is demanding that the Shiprider policing program be taken out of budget implementation bill. Brian Masse, the NDP border critic is pushing for separate legislation and pointed out that, “it’s totally irresponsible to have it as part of the Budget Implementation Act.” He added, “There’s significant policing issues that really warrant a standalone bill. If it was so important that they did all the fanfare for it, why doesn’t it warrant its own process?” The proposed changes could have serious sovereignty implications with regards to accountability, due process and civil rights and therefore, need to be fully scrutinized. <a name='more'></a><br /><br />The U.S. and Canada are also scheduled to deploy a land-based version of the Shiprider program at some point this summer. As part of the security perimeter deal, both countries will, “implement two Next-Generation pilot projects to create integrated teams in areas such as intelligence and criminal investigations, and an intelligence-led uniformed presence between ports of entry.” In September 2011, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/ag/speeches/2011/ag-speech-110914.html">U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder</a> revealed plans that would allow law enforcement officers to operate on both sides of the border. He announced that, “the creation of ‘NextGen’ teams of cross-designated officers would allow us to more effectively identify, assess, and interdict persons and organizations involved in transnational crime.” Holder went on to say, “In conjunction with the other provisions included in the Beyond the Border Initiative, such a move would enhance our cross-border efforts and advance our information-sharing abilities.” Both countries continue to expand the nature and scope of joint law enforcement operations, along with intelligence collection and sharing.<br /><br />On April 20 of this year, the Red River Integrated Border Enforcement Team’s (IBET) <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/mb/prog-serv/border-frontalier-eng.htm">joint intelligence office</a> was opened in Altona, Manitoba. The facility will house representatives from the RCMP, U.S. Border Patrol, Homeland Security. Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), as well as U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ibet-eipf/index-eng.htm">IBET</a> is a binational partnership designed to, “enhance border integrity and security along the shared Canada/U.S. border through identification, investigation and interdiction of persons, organizations and goods that threaten the national security of both countries or that are involved in organized criminal activity.” The specialized teams have been, “established in strategic regions to ensure more effective border enforcement capability between ports of entry, based on intelligence-led policing.” The new joint headquarters could serve as a model for other IBETs along the northern border.<br /><br />On May 8, the CBP and the CBSA <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/ynews/releases/20120508-increase-nexus-benefits.shtm">announced</a> that, “they are delivering on key commitments under the U.S.-Canada Beyond the Border Action Plan for Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness—increasing benefits to NEXUS members, streamlining the NEXUS membership renewal process and launching a plan to increase NEXUS membership.” Under the <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/trusted_traveler/nexus_prog/nexus.xml">NEXUS program</a>, pre-screened travelers are granted expedited access across the border, by air, land or sea. Canadian Public Safety Minister Vic Toews explained that, “The Border Action Plan is designed to speed up legitimate trade and travel, and improve security in North America by aligning the entry of people and goods at the perimeter while streamlining processes at the Canada-U.S. border. With these commitments to retain and increase NEXUS membership, Canada and the United States will increase efficiency to better focus their resources and examination efforts on travellers of high or unknown risk.” NEXUS is part of the process of implementing equivalent biometric standards across North America which could be used to restrict, track and trace our movements.  <br /><br />Last month, Canada’s federal privacy commissioner Jennifer Stoddart, along with her provincial and territorial colleagues urged transparency and respect of Canadian privacy standards with regards to the perimeter security agreement. A <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca/media/nr-c/2012/nr-c_120402_e.asp">joint resolution</a> recommended that, “Any initiatives under the plan that collect personal information should also include appropriate redress and remedy mechanisms to review files for accuracy, correct inaccuracies and restrict disclosures to other countries; Parliament, provincial Privacy Commissioners and civil society should be engaged as initiatives under the plan take shape; Information about Canadians should be stored on Canadian soil whenever feasible or at least be subject to Canadian protection; and Any use of new surveillance technologies within Canada such as unmanned aerial vehicles must be subject to appropriate controls set out in a proper regulatory framework.” According to a self-imposed deadline, the U.S. and Canada are supposed to release privacy provisions associated with the perimeter security deal by May 30. <br /><br />The perimeter agreement is also getting the attention of provincial and state leaders. B.C. Premier Christy Clark and Washington Governor Chris Gregoire have <a href="http://www.governor.wa.gov/news/news-view.asp?pressRelease=1853&newsType=1">signed</a>, “a joint letter to President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Stephen Harper commending the U.S.-Canada Beyond the Border Action Plan and committing British Columbia and Washington to support and expedite federal commitments to improve the flow of people, goods and services across the border.” When the perimeter security deal was first released last year, Premier Clark issued a <a href="http://www.newsroom.gov.bc.ca/2011/12/statement-on-north-american-perimeter-security-announcement.html">statement</a> which welcomed the announcement. In addition, Washington’s state Legislature <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/8016-S.PL-US%20and%20Canada%20action%20plans.pdf">passed</a> a joint memorial which also acknowledged its support. The backing of governments at all levels will further assist in implementing some of the Beyond the Border initiatives. Not to mention the fact that state and provincial regional integration is already being achieved in areas of trade, the environment and energy.<br /><br />As the U.S.-Canada action plan implementation process continues, there still remains many concerns with the further integration and militarization of the northern border. This includes the loss of sovereignty and risks to privacy rights related to more cross-border sharing of personal information. While there have been online consultations surrounding the perimeter security agreement, there has yet to be any open public hearings or congressional and parliamentary debates.    <br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/04/nafta-partners-take-steps-to-boost_09.html">NAFTA Partners Take Steps to Boost Trilateral Relationship</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/02/counter-terrorism-and-northern-border.html">Northern Border Drug Strategy Tied to Perimeter Security Deal</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/03/perimeter-approach-to-security-and.html">The Transformation of the U.S.-Canada Border</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/03/north-american-leaders-summit-and.html">The North American Leaders Summit and Reviving Trilateral Integration</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5729079245380150434" /></a><br />While bilateral initiatives have dominated North American issues over the last couple of years, the trilateral relationship has suffered. With a series of high-level meetings, the U.S., Canada and Mexico are taking steps to boost the NAFTA partnership. First, the defense ministers met to discuss shared continental security threats. This was followed by a leaders summit which pledged to deepen trade, regulatory, energy and security cooperation. The recent meetings have caused some to once again take notice of the incremental efforts to merge all three countries into a North American Union.<br /><br />In what was hailed as an historic event, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, Canadian Defense Minister Peter MacKay, Mexican Secretary of National Defense Guillermo Galvan, and Mexican Secretary of the Navy Mariano Mendoza recently held the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=15141">Inaugural Meeting of North American Defense Ministers</a>. As part of a framework they agreed to, “ Develop a joint trilateral defense threat assessment for North America to deepen our common understanding of the threats and challenges we face. Explore ways to improve our support to the efforts of civilian public security agencies in countering illicit activities in our respective countries and the hemisphere, such as narcotics trafficking. Explore how we can collaborate to increase the speed and efficiency with which our armed forces support civilian-led responses to disasters. Continue to work together to strengthen hemispheric defense forums.” The ministers also committed to enhancing cooperation in the fight against transnational criminal organizations. The trilateral defense meeting is part of the ongoing efforts to establish a fully integrated North American security perimeter. <a name='more'></a><br /><br />On April 2, President Barack Obama hosted Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Mexican President Felipe Calderon for the sixth North American Leaders Summit. In a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/04/02/joint-statement-north-american-leaders">joint statement</a> they reaffirmed their, “commitment to further develop our thriving political and economic partnership with a consistent and strategic long-term vision.” The leaders acknowledged that, “continued North American competitiveness requires secure supply chains and efficient borders. We remain committed to achieving this through co-operative approaches.” With respect to regulatory initiatives, they agreed to move forward trilaterally in areas such as “vehicle emission standards, railroad safety, the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Workplace Chemicals, and aligning principles of our regulatory approaches to nanomaterials.” They also announced the creation of the <a href="http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/international/Documents/napapi.pdf">North American Plan for Animal and Pandemic Influenza</a>. Following the leaders summit, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk engaged in discussions with Canadian Trade Minister Ed Fast and Mexico’s Secretary of the Economy Bruno Ferrari, as part of the <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/2012/april/joint-statement-2012-nafta-commission-meeting">NAFTA Commission Meeting</a>. <br /><br />In their joint communique, the leaders recognized, “the growing regional and federal cooperation in the area of continental energy, including electricity generation and interconnection and welcome increasing North American energy trade.” They emphasized the need to deepen, “cooperation to enhance our collective energy security, including the safe and efficient exploration and exploitation of resources.” There was no mention of the <a href="http://www.transcanada.com/keystone.html">Keystone XL Pipeline Project</a> which would carry oil from western Canada to the Texas gulf coast. President Obama has blocked the plan pending further environmental review. While speaking at the <a href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/director%E2%80%99s-forum-the-right-honourable-stephen-harper-prime-minister-canada-0">Woodrow Wilson Center</a> following the leaders summit, Prime Minister Harper made it clear that even if the pipeline is approved, Canadian oil will be heading for Asian markets. Meanwhile, the U.S. has been pushing Mexico to further open up its oil sector to private investment. In February, they <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/02/184235.htm">signed</a> an agreement regarding, “the development of oil and gas reservoirs that cross the international maritime boundary between the two countries in the Gulf of Mexico.” <br /><br />The leaders joint statement also noted that, “The <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/fact-sheets/2011/november/outlines-trans-pacific-partnership-agreement">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) provides an opportunity to further deepen our trade relationship and create jobs. The United States welcomes Canada’s and Mexico’s interest in joining the TPP.” During a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/04/02/joint-press-conference-president-obama-president-calderon-mexico-and-pri">press conference</a> with his NAFTA counterparts, Obama confirmed that, “Consultations with our TPP partners are now underway on how new members can meet the high standards of this trade agreement, which could be a real model for the world.” The U.S. is spearheading TPP negotiations which also include Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Japan has also <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/2011/november/statement-us-trade-representative-ron-kirk-japans">expressed</a> interest in being part of the TPP process. The door is also open for other countries to join which is why many consider it to be a building block for an Asia-Pacific free trade zone. <br /><br />Robert Pastor who has been a leading advocate for deeper North American integration <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/11/14/2502452/were-neglecting-our-north-american.html">described</a> the TPP as a flawed strategy. He explained Canada and Mexico’s decision to join, “as a defensive measure to ensure that they protect what they gained from NAFTA.”  Pastor warned how, “the TPP will divert scarce political capital and attention from North America.” In contrast, the <a href="http://www.as-coa.org/articles/submission-comments-office-united-states-trade-representative-canadas-expression-interest">Council of the Americas</a> are of the opinion that it would boost the integrated North American economy. They view the TPP as a “promising vehicle to support the updating of our bilateral and trilateral trading relationships within North America to the high standards of twenty-first century free-trade agreements.” While on a visit to the U.S. in March, Canadian Trade Minister Ed Fast <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/media_commerce/comm/news-communiques/2012/03/12a.aspx?view=d">proclaimed</a> that, “As neighbours and friends, we can and should build the TPP together. As like-minded allies, we can ensure that high standards are included in the TPP on such issues as investment, regulatory cooperation, state-owned enterprises and labour provisions.” If  Canada and Mexico are accepted into the TPP fold, it could be used to renegotiate and expand NAFTA. <br /><br />The U.S., Canada and Mexico have also agreed to <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=4727">launch</a> a consolidated Central America Integration System-North America Security Dialogue to deepen regional coordination and cooperation. This includes working closer together in the fight against transnational organized crime, arms trafficking and money laundering. During the leaders joint news conference, President Obama praised Mexico’s courage in standing up to the drug cartels, and added, “today each of us reaffirmed our commitment to meeting this challenge together -- because that’s the only way that we’re going to succeed.” President Calderon went on to say, “The security of North America is absolutely tied to each of its member states.” The <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/pl/172874.htm">Merida Initiative</a> has expanded the U.S.-Mexico security partnership. It has provided military equipment, training, infrastructure development, along with border security and information technology enhancement. At the 2009 North American Leaders Summit, Prime Minister Harper <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=2721">announced</a> Canadian support for Mexico’s fight against drug trafficking and transnational organized crime. <br /><br />Mexico’s drug war is increasingly being seen as a continental problem that requires continental solutions which is further pushing the NAFTA partnership into a common security front. This is escalating the militarization of the borders, integration in areas of law enforcement and the military, as well as advancing the development of a North American security perimeter. <br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/11/canada-and-mexico-to-join-us-in-nafta.html">Canada and Mexico to Join U.S. in NAFTA of the Pacific</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/12/pretext-for-north-american-homeland_11.html">Pretext for a North American Homeland Security Perimeter</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/05/indoctrinating-new-generation-to-think.html">Indoctrinating a New Generation to Think North American</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/03/north-american-leaders-summit-and.html">The North American Leaders Summit and Reviving Trilateral Integration</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5723563199970016098" /></a><br />With the demise of the Security and Prosperity Partnership, the U.S. has essentially put Canada and Mexico on separate tracks. It has pursued dual-bilateralism with both its NAFTA partners as the primary means of advancing continental integration with regards to trade, regulatory and security initiatives. The upcoming North American Leaders Summit, which will be held in Washington, D.C. on April 2, could be used as a means of reviving the trilateral cooperation model.<br /><br />While much of my focus has been on the U.S.-Canada <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/bbg-tpf/perimeter-security-and-economic-competitiveness-action-plan">Beyond the Border</a> and the <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/rcc-ccr/joint-action-plan-canada-united-states-regulatory-cooperation-council">Regulatory Cooperation Council</a> (RCC) action plans, the U.S. is also pursuing a similar agenda with Mexico. This includes working towards a common security perimeter. In 2010, the U.S. and Mexico issued the Twenty-First Century Border Management <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/declaration-government-united-states-america-and-government-united-mexican-states-c">declaration</a>. This established the Executive Steering Committee (ESC) to implement joint border related projects to enhance economic prosperity and security. In December of last year, the ESC adopted its <a href="http://photos.state.gov/libraries/mexico/310329/15dec11/Action-Plan_15_DIC.pdf">2012 action plan</a> which sets goals in areas of binational infrastructure coordination, risk management, law enforcement cooperation, along with improving cross-border commerce and ties. A <a href="http://mexico.usembassy.gov/press-releases/meeting-of-the-united-states-mexico.html">press release</a> explained that through the ESC, “we are developing and managing our shared border in an integrated fashion to facilitate the secure, efficient, and rapid flows of goods and people and reduce the costs of doing business between our two countries.” The ESC meeting also acknowledged bilateral accomplishments in expanding the use of trusted traveler initiatives such as the <a href="http://www.globalentry.gov/index.html">Global Entry Program</a>. <a name='more'></a> <br /><br />In May of 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calderon <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/joint-statement-president-barack-obama-and-president-felipe-calder-n">directed</a> the creation of the High-Level Regulatory Cooperation Council (HLRCC). In February of this year, the HLRCC released a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/oira/irc/united-states-mexico-high-level-regulatory-cooperation-council-work-plan.pdf">work plan</a> whereby the U.S. and Mexico will seek greater regulatory alignment in the areas of food, transportation, nanotechnology, e-health, as well as oil and gas development standards. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce <a href="http://www.uschamber.com/press/releases/2012/march/us-chamber-applauds-plan-enhanced-us-mexico-regulatory-cooperation">applauded</a> the plan for enhanced regulatory cooperation between both countries. The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/oira/irc/high-level_regulatory_cooperation_council-terms_of_reference_final.pdf">terms of reference</a> for the HLRCC also recognized that, “some regulatory challenges require trilateral cooperation among the three Parties to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the United States and Mexico intend to involve the Government of Canada when it is necessary to focus on issues of common interest in North America.” The U.S.-Mexico HLRCC has similar goals to the U.S.-Canada RCC. At some point, these dual-bilateral councils could come together to form a single continental regulatory regime.<br /><br />In his article, the <a href="http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/article/1119080--the-road-to-washington-runs-through-mexico">road to Washington runs through Mexico</a>, Robert Pastor, who has been a leading proponent of North American integration, criticized Canada’s continental policy. He argued that, “Instead of collaborating with Mexico to persuade the United States to address shared problems and opportunities in North America, Canada has excluded Mexico and approached the U.S. on its own.” Pastor offered potential reasons for this strategy, “Some suggest Canadians fear being tainted by association with Mexico’s violence. Others believe its ‘special relationship’ with the United States gives it an advantage that it would lose if it allied with Mexico. And some think that two countries can walk faster than three.” He further elaborated on his position, “Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s insistence on bilateralism — or rather ‘dual-bilateralism’ because the U.S. has to deal with Mexico too — has not worked. Regulations will not be harmonized; a uniform set of customs forms and traveller IDs will not be implemented; a continent-wide transportation and infrastructure plan will not be contemplated without a clear vision and strategy by and for North America.”<br /><br />Robert Pastor’s op-ed which appeared in the Toronto Star also conceded that, “Working the U.S. Congress by itself, neither Canada nor Mexico can secure its goals. Working together, with the support of the Obama administration, the three governments could design a seamless market and eliminate an expensive, inefficient tax based on rules of origin.” He recommended, “Instead of competing against each other to gain access to Asian markets, our three countries should focus on continental competitiveness and approach China together on issues related to currency, unfair trade practices and climate change.” He insisted, “If Canada were to change its ‘divide-and-be-conquered’ strategy to a ‘unite-and-govern together’ approach on the new North American agenda, Mexico and the U.S. would join, as they did with NAFTA. And Canada could achieve its goals and the continent’s at the same time.” Pastor further lays out his plan to rejuvenate trilateral integration in his book, the <a href="http://www.american.edu/sis/cnas/northamericanidea.cfm">North American Idea: A Vision of a Continental Future</a>.<br /><br />The Woodrow Wilson Center hosted an event in December 2011 entitled the <a href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/the-death-trilateralism-the-nafta-neighborhood-views-the-united-states-mexico-and-canada">Death of Trilateralism in the NAFTA Neighborhood</a>, which examined the evolution of regional economic cooperation between the U.S., Canada and Mexico. During the proceedings, a panel agreed that the death of trilateralism has been exaggerated, but pointed out that, “dual-bilateralism, in which the United States works with Canada and Mexico separately, has become more common. Participants noted this is particularly apparent when dealing with regulatory, energy, and border issues. Countries are still, however, looking to harmonize and work toward trilateralism.” The meeting called for greater regional engagement and emphasized, “the need to focus on issues such as regulatory cooperation, infrastructure, and border efficiency.” Discussions also centered around whether North America needed a grand new plan to move deep integration forward.<br /><br />On April 2, President Barack Obama will host the sixth North American Leaders Summit which will include the participation of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Mexican President Felipe Calderon. According to a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/16/statement-press-secretary-north-american-leaders-summit">statement</a> by the press secretary, the meeting will, “focus on economic growth and competitiveness, citizen security, energy, and climate change.” While announcing the upcoming summit, Prime Minister Harper <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=1&featureId=6&pageId=26&id=4692">praised</a> the NAFTA trilateral relationship, “Canada, the United States and Mexico have forged a strong partnership built on free and open trade and close cooperation on security.” He went on to say, “The government’s number one priority remains the creation of jobs, growth and long-term prosperity for all Canadians, particularly through trade, including with our close friends the United States and Mexico.” The NAFTA governments are looking to expand trade with other countries. This includes Canada and Mexico’s efforts to <a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/11/canada-and-mexico-to-join-us-in-nafta.html">join</a> the U.S., along with other nations already engaged in the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks. The forthcoming North American Leaders Summit will be the first since 2009, which has caused some to question the current state of trilateralism.<br /><br />When it comes to continental integration, the U.S. has shifted much of its focus to pursuing dual-bilateral agendas with both Canada and Mexico. This includes efforts to establish a North American security perimeter. At some point, these parallel initiatives could converge into one. While it is unlikely that the upcoming leaders summit will bring about any grand new plan, it could be used as a starting point to revive the whole trilateral process. With the NAFTA framework still intact, the vision for a North American Union has not been abandoned.  <br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2012/03/perimeter-approach-to-security-and.html">The Transformation of the U.S.-Canada Border</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/11/north-american-integration-and-ties.html">North American Integration and the Ties That Bind</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/03/expanding-us-mexico-economic-and.html">Expanding U.S.-Mexico Economic and Security Cooperation</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.ca/2011/02/perimeter-security-and-future-of-north.html">Perimeter Security and the Future of North American Integration</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5719059733981414658" /></a><br />Through a series of bilateral meetings, U.S. and Canadian officials are busy working out the details of the perimeter security action plan. This includes a recent joint crime forum that dealt with border and law enforcement issues. These various discussions are part of the implementation process which when finished would bring about the complete transformation of the northern border and another step closer in the creation of a fully integrated North American security perimeter.<br /><br />In early March, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano met with Canadian Justice Minister Rob Nicholson and Public Safety Minister Vic Toews as part of the <a href="http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/media/nr/2012/nr20120302-eng.aspx?rss=false">Cross-Border Crime Forum</a>. On the agenda was, “transnational crime issues such as organized crime, counter-terrorism, smuggling, economic crime and other emerging cross-border threats.” Both countries also signed a memorandum of understanding on the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/opa/mou-hstc-rcmp-exchange-of-information.pdf">Dissemination and Exchange of Information</a> to combat human smuggling and trafficking. The meetings were used as an opportunity to further advance U.S.-Canada cooperation in areas of law enforcement, criminal justice and intelligence. This ties in with my previous article which <a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2012/02/counter-terrorism-and-northern-border.html">detailed</a> the Obama administration’s new counter-narcotics strategy for the northern border that includes closer collaboration with Canada in the war on drugs. Much of the joint crime forum discussions focused around the progress being made on the <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/bbg-tpf/perimeter-security-and-economic-competitiveness-action-plan">Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness Action Plan</a>, announced in December 2011. <a name='more'></a> <br /><br />A <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/March/12-ag-277.html">readout</a> of Attorney General Holder and Secretary Napolitano’s visit to Ottawa explained that talks with their Canadian counterparts centered largely around promoting the perimeter security agreement. It highlighted, “efforts to develop the next-generation of integrated cross-border law enforcement operations, and improve information sharing practices.”  Attorney General Holder stated, “Our productive discussions today at the Cross Border Crime Forum go a long way toward advancing a key pillar of the Beyond the Border initiative that President Obama and Prime Minister Harper announced last year: integrated law enforcement that adds value to our relationship by leveraging shared resources, improving information sharing and increasing coordination of efforts.” Secretary Napolitano emphasized that, “We will continue to work with Canada to further enhance information sharing and integrate our cross border law enforcement operations, strengthening the national and economic security of both our nations.” As part of the perimeter security deal, both countries are moving ahead with harmonizing intelligence sharing capabilities. <br /><br />The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recently <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/newsroom/news_releases/national/02292012_2.xml">hosted</a> stakeholder meetings regarding programs and initiatives found in the Beyond the Border action plan. CBP Acting Deputy Commissioner Thomas Winkowski confirmed that the, “agreement forged by President Obama and Prime Minister Harper is about strengthening and expediting trade and travel between our countries.” He went on to say, “It’s about finding common-sense solutions to our most complicated problems. And it’s about extending national security for both of our nations, well away from the border.” CBSA President Luc Portelance acknowledged, “As these joint meetings with stakeholders indicate, we are committed to working with our U.S. partners to bring about greater consistency, efficiency and predictability in the management of our shared border.” The perimeter security deal will mean deeper integration between both border agencies. Some have warned that it might force Canada to harmonize its immigration and refugee policies with U.S. practices. Over a period of time, this could lead to the creation of a binational institution that would manage the northern border. <br /><br />Steven Chase of the Globe and Mail <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/pmo-cool-to-us-officials-norad-border-musings/article2356680/">reported</a> that during recent border security discussions, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary of International Affairs, Alan Bersin commented on how, “he believes the time will come when Canada and the United States have a joint organization to handle border controls – what he described as a NORAD border.” Bersin is quoted as saying, “Why should we have separate admissibility processes … if, in fact, North American security would suggest that a Canadian and a U.S. immigrations and customs official ought to be working together to clear people in Frankfurt who are coming into Canada, to clear them such that they would be able then to come seamlessly across (the joint border into) the United States.” An <a href="http://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&id=8734">article</a> by Christopher Sands of the Hudson Institute also included another top level Homeland Security official using the same NORAD analogy to describe future joint border controls. David Heyman explained that this, “could be a model for how the two countries might handle the protection of citizens against 21st-century threats from terrorism, pandemics, cyberattacks, and organized crime.”<br /><br />On February 16, the Conservative government introduced the <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/releases/2012/2012-02-16.asp">Protecting Canada’s Immigration System Act</a>. The legislation proposed, “reforms to the asylum system to make it faster and fairer, measures to address human smuggling, and the authority to make it mandatory to provide biometric data.” The new changes would put Canada in line with the U.S. and other international partners. Immigration Minister Jason Kenney praised the use of biometrics as an, “important new tool to help protect the safety and security of Canadians by reducing identity fraud and identity theft.” He added, it “will improve our ability to keep violent criminals and those who pose a threat to Canada out. In short, biometrics will strengthen the integrity of Canada’s immigration system while helping facilitate legitimate travel.” Under the section about sharing relevant information to improve immigration and border determinations, the U.S.-Canada <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/wh/us-canada-btb-action-plan.pdf">action plan</a> calls for implementing, “systematic and automated biographic information-sharing capability by 2013 and biometric information-sharing capability by 2014.” There are fears that a joint biometric identification system would be used to track Canadians and Americans alike.<br /><br />U.S.-Canada bilateral dialogue on strategic issues concerning the Beyond the Border deal continues as the action plan lays out deadlines where initiatives will be incrementally implemented over the next several years. The proposed changes promise to bring about a radical transformation of the northern border. This will further bring Canadian security practices in line with American ones and under the reach of the Department of Homeland Security. <br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2012/02/counter-terrorism-and-northern-border.html">Northern Border Drug Strategy Tied to Perimeter Security Deal</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2011/09/us-canada-perimeter-security-and.html">Perimeter Security and the Consolidation of North America</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2011/04/us-dictating-north-american-air-travel.html">U.S. Dictating North American Air Travel Security</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2011/08/advancing-us-canada-economic-energy-and.html">Advancing U.S.-Canada Economic, Energy and Security Integration</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

This includes both countries strengthening integrated cross-border intelligence sharing and law enforcement operations. Canada has also released a comprehensive counter-terrorism plan aimed at combating the threats of domestic and international violent extremism. The separate U.S.-Canada undertakings are both tied to the Beyond the Border deal and efforts to establish a North American security perimeter.<br /><br />In January, the Obama administration announced the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/national_northern_border_counternarcotics_strategy_.pdf">National Northern Border Counternarcotics Strategy</a>. A <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/news-releases-remarks/office-of-national-drug-control-policy-releases-northern-border-drug-control-strategy">press release</a> by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) described how the plan seeks, “to reduce the two-way flow of illicit drugs between the United States and Canada by increasing coordination among Federal, state, local, and tribal enforcement authorities, enhancing intelligence sharing between counterdrug agencies, and strengthening ongoing counterdrug partnerships and initiatives with the Government of Canada and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).” Senator Charles Schumer <a href="http://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/schumer-gillibrand-owens-announce-feds-release-first-ever-northern-border-anti-drug-strategy_plan-improves-international-coordination-to-shut-down-flow-of-drugs-from-canada-to-ny">proclaimed</a>, “I pushed so hard for this strategy to be finalized because we have to immediately stop the flow of drugs from Canada into New York, and it’s going to take an inter-agency and international effort.” He added, “I’m pleased that this agreement lays the groundwork for Canadian and American law enforcement to work hand-in-glove to fight the drug trade.” Schumer has also <a href="http://ltpbazzo.com/2011/12/09/schumer-statement-on-historic-beyond-the-border-agreement-between-u-s-and-canada/">endorsed</a> the new cross-border action plan. In addition, he is pushing to establish a <a href="http://schumer.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=336031&">Northern Border Intelligence Center</a> in Franklin County, NY to better coordinate efforts to fight drug smuggling and other cross-border criminal activities. <a name='more'></a> <br /><br />While commenting on the new plan to disrupt the flow of drugs over the U.S.-Canada border, ONDCP Deputy Director of State, Local and Tribal Affairs, Ben Tucker <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/01/20/strategy-reduce-drug-trafficking-along-our-northern-border">explained</a> that, “By strengthening integrated cross-border law enforcement between our two countries, the Strategy supports a key area of cooperation outlined by President Obama and Prime Minister Harper in the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/02/04/declaration-president-obama-and-prime-minister-harper-canada-beyond-bord">Beyond the Border declaration</a>.” In December of last year, the leaders issued the follow up <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/bbg-tpf/perimeter-security-and-economic-competitiveness-action-plan">Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness Action Plan</a>. The deal focuses on addressing security threats early, facilitating trade, economic growth and jobs, integrating cross-border law enforcement, as well as improving infrastructure and cyber-security. As part of the agreement, both countries will, “create integrated teams in areas such as intelligence and criminal investigations, and an intelligence-led uniformed presence between ports of entry.” The U.S. and Canada continue to expand the nature and scope of joint law enforcement operations, along with intelligence collection and sharing.<br /><br />The new northern border drug strategy also called for increasing judicial cooperation, improving information-sharing and extradition arrangements, as well as better coordinating cross-border undercover operations and investigations with Canada. It recommended working towards, “operational fusion with Canadian partners in interoperable communications, technology, and activities. The ability to integrate Canadian and U.S. technology, including sensors, videos, radio communications, and radar feeds, will permit automated sharing of timely information.” The document also argued that,  "It is imperative that Canada and the United States work together to expedite the sharing of information from electronic communication service providers; and share information necessary to lay the foundation for intercepting internet and voice communications.” While various new measures are being put in place to thwart illegal drug, terrorist and other criminal activity, they could easily be used to target anyone else the government deems a threat.<br /><br />The use of technology is emphasized throughout the report, “Technical collection capabilities and programs along the Northern border, such as thermal camera systems, License Plate Readers (LPRs), Mobile Surveillance Systems, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), national distress and command and control networks, and Remote Video Surveillance Systems will be deployed and carefully coordinated among participating agencies.” The new strategy also recommended enhancing air and maritime domain awareness and response capabilities as another means of disrupting the flow of illegal drugs across the U.S.-Canada border. In February of 2009, U.S. Customs and Border Protection began using <a href="http://cbp.gov/archived/xp/cgov/newsroom/news_releases/archives/2009_news_releases/february_2009/02162009.xml.html">unmanned aerial vehicles</a> on the northern border and <a href="http://cbp.gov/archived/xp/cgov/newsroom/news_releases/archives/2011_news_archive/01212011_7.xml.html">expanded</a> the program in January of last year. The UAV drones are being deployed in support of border security, counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism missions. Congress recently <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/7/coming-to-a-sky-near-you/print/">passed</a> a bill that will make it easier for the government to use surveillance drones and it is projected that that there could be up to 30,000 in operation over U.S. skies by 2020.<br /><br />On February 9, the Conservative government released the <a href="http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/prg/ns/2012-cts-eng.aspx">Building Resilience Against Terrorism: Canada’s Counter-terrorism Strategy</a>. The new plan is aimed at countering domestic, as well as international terrorism and better protecting Canadian interests. It outlined counter-terrorism efforts under four pillars, “prevent individuals from engaging in terrorism; detect the activities of individuals who may pose a terrorist threat; deny terrorists the means and opportunity to carry out their activities; and respond proportionately, rapidly and in an organized manner to terrorist activities and mitigate their effects.” The report stressed partnership and cooperation as the key to achieving these goals which, “will require an integrated approach not only by the Government of Canada, but by all levels of government, law enforcement agencies, the private sector and citizens, in collaboration with international partners and key allies, such as the United States.”  The strategy will, “serve to reinforce security initiatives between Canada and the U.S. and will complement the Canada-U.S. Beyond the Border: A Shared Vision for Perimeter Security and Competitiveness.”<br /><br />The anti-terror policy identified Sunni Islamist extremism as Canada’s top security threat. It also warned of homegrown terrorists and lone wolf attackers, including issue-based domestic extremism which it stated, “tends to be based on grievances—real or perceived—revolving around the promotion of various causes such as animal rights, white supremacy, environmentalism and anti-capitalism.” CTV News <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20120216/Greenpeace-Native-groups-extremist-threats-120216/%20/%20ixzz1muEaUuBw">reported</a> that similar intelligence assessments can be found in documents regarding CSIS and RCMP  surveillance between 2005-2010 which categorized, “some animal rights, environmental and aboriginal activists alongside terrorists that pose a threat to national security.” The documents were obtained through access to information requests. They became the basis of the research paper <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10439463.2011.605131">Making up Terror Identities</a> where authors Jeffrey Monaghan and Kevin Walby voiced concerns on how, “intelligence agencies have blurred the categories of terrorism, extremism and activism into an aggregate threat matrix. This blurring of threat categories expands the purview of security intelligence agencies, leading to net-widening where a greater diversity of actions are governed through surveillance processes and criminal law.”<br /><br />The never ending war on drugs and war on terrorism are being used to justify the huge police state security apparatus being assembled. This includes the militarization of the northern border and plans for a North American security perimeter. In the name of national security, there has been a steady erosion of civil liberties and privacy rights in both the U.S. and Canada. Our freedoms are under assault. The amount of information being collected and shared on all aspects of our daily lives has expanded and is being stored in massive databases. Sweeping new surveillance powers targeting terrorists and other criminals are being increasingly turned against those who are critical of government policy. There is a concerted effort to demonize political opponents, activists, protesters and other peaceful groups. We are witnessing the criminalization of dissent where those who oppose the government’s agenda are being labelled as terrorists and a threat to security.  <br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2012/02/us-canada-strengthening-security.html">Strengthening U.S.-Canada Security Interests</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2011/04/north-american-perimeter-security-and.html">Perimeter Security and the Militarization of the Northern Border</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2010/12/new-border-vision-and-north-american_11.html">Towards a North American Security Perimeter</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2011/12/pretext-for-north-american-homeland_11.html">Pretext for a North American Homeland Security Perimeter</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5705907365763376402" /></a><br />The U.S. and Canada recently signed several bilateral agreements that will further strengthen continental security and defense cooperation. Deeper military integration between both countries is part of efforts to establish a North American security perimeter and better address common global threats.<br /><br />Following the recent Permanent Joint Board on Defense (PJBD <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130701034554/http://forces.gc.ca/site/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-eng.asp?id=4074">meeting</a> which took place in Ottawa, the Commander of Canada Command, Lt.-Gen Walter Semianiw and the Commander of  North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), Gen. Charles Jacoby, Jr. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130522201722/http://www.cjoc-coic.forces.gc.ca/fs-ev/2012/01/20120127-eng.asp">signed</a> three military documents. The first was the Combined Defense Plan which a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130618225224/http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-eng.asp?id=4073">backgrounder</a> described as a, “planning framework between Canada Command, its counterpart USNORTHCOM, and NORAD for enhanced defense cooperation between Canada and the U.S. should governments require each other’s assistance.” The second is the Information Sharing Memorandum of Understanding, “an arrangement between Canada Command, its counterpart USNORTHCOM and NORAD to identify and provide for ease of sharing information amongst the three organizations.” The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130226010127/http://www.northcom.mil/News/2008/021408.html">Civil Assistance Plan</a>, which was originally signed in 2008 and allows the armed forces of one nation to support the other during an emergency was also renewed for two years. <a name='more'></a> <br /><br />Lee Berthiaume of Postmedia News <a href="http://www.globalnews.ca/canada+us+lay+out+military+responsibilities+should+north+america+be+attacked/6442566679/story.html">reported</a> that, “The Combined Defense Plan has been under discussion for several years and would further integrate cross-border military co-operation at a time when the Harper government is trying to reassure Washington it has a reliable partner in Canada when it comes to security.” Defense Minister Peter MacKay is quoted as saying, “This agreement provides a framework for the combined defense of Canada and the U.S. during peace, contingencies, and war.” He added, “The plan describes the authorities and means by which the two governments would approve homeland military operations in the event of a mutually agreed threat, and how our two militaries would collaborate and share information.” In his speech in front of the PJBD, Minister MacKay also called for, “increased military involvement implementing the Beyond the Border strategy, saying the Canadian Forces and its American counterparts should be supporting civilian agencies monitoring the cross-border security.” Also on the agenda at the defense forum was security cooperation in the Arctic, along with Canadian and U.S. engagement in the Western Hemisphere.<br /><br />In an article for iPolitics, Colin Horgan <a href="http://www.ipolitics.ca/2012/01/24/security-linked-to-economy-mackay-tells-bilateral-defence-meeting/">wrote</a> that at the recent bilateral defense meeting, “MacKay noted that such initiatives as <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/bbg-tpf/perimeter-security-and-economic-competitiveness-action-plan">Beyond the Border</a> and the <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/rcc-ccr/joint-action-plan-canada-united-states-regulatory-cooperation-council">Regulatory Cooperation Council</a> Action Plan will work to ensure that the vital economic partnership that joins our two countries continues to be the cornerstone of our economic competitiveness and security.” Defense Minister MacKay emphasized that security is linked to the economy and called for even greater cooperation to support the dual action plans. He stated, “We need to increasingly focus our military forces in support of those civilian departments and agencies that have the lead.” MacKay also explained, “We need to all work together to mitigate capability gaps, share best practices and co-operate on new approaches.” He went on to say, “there is still room for more integrated collaboration – domestically and bi-nationally.”  <br /><br />The latest military agreements further promote a perimeter approach to security. They are part of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130218085010/http://www.northcom.mil/News/Signed%20Vision%20in%20English%2012%20Mar%2010.pdf">Tri-Command Vision</a> efforts to merge NORAD, USNORTHCOM and Canada Command into one. As for the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110316223451/http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-eng.asp?cat=00&id=298">PJBD</a>, it has once again become more relevant as a venue for bilateral security and military dialogue. Created in 1940 the panel, “is the senior advisory body on continental defense. It is composed of military and diplomatic representatives from both nations.” Over the years, it has, “served as a strategic-level military board charged with considering, in a broad sense, land, sea, air and space issues.” This includes areas concerning, “policy, operations, financial, logistics and other aspects of Canada-U.S. defense relations.” The PJBD is well positioned to play a significant role in plans for a fully integrated North American security perimeter, as well as in other facets of the evolving Canada-U.S. partnership.<br /><br />On January 6, the Obama administration released the new document, <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/Defense_Strategic_Guidance.pdf">Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense</a>. The new strategy calls for maintaining a strong presence in the Middle East, as well as an expanding role in the Asia-Pacific region. Much of the focus will be on countering China’s rising power. This will include supporting large bases in Japan and South Korea, along with stationing troops in Australia. The U.S. will also continue efforts to forge stronger military alliances with the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam and Burma. While the plan envisions a leaner military force, there is little doubt that Washington will continue to police the world. How does Canada fit into this new realignment of American strategic priorities? It is clear that the U.S. will rely more on its allies during international missions. Canada may gain a greater voice in future military operations, but it will also mean that they will have to bear more of the burden. In the coming years, as NATO members begin cutting defense spending, Canada will be counted on to play an even bigger role in any possible overseas conflicts. <br /><br />Whether it’s the perimeter security deal, the ongoing mission in Afghanistan or the bombing campaign that took place in Libya, the U.S. and Canada continue to enhance security and military cooperation. Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, both countries have further deepened their defense relationship. In addition, Canada has pursued a more U.S.-style foreign policy. This includes imposing tougher sanctions on Iran, along with further expanding sanctions against Syria. Much like the U.S., Harper has singled out Iran as a threat to international peace and security. He has echoed the same sentiments that the regime is seeking a nuclear weapon and would be prepared to use it. Defense Minister Peter MacKay has also indicated that if necessary, Canada's armed forces are ready to offer assistance in Syria. More than ever, the U.S, and Canada share a more common approach to advancing security interests in not only North America, but around the globe. <br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2011/12/pretext-for-north-american-homeland_11.html">Pretext for a North American Homeland Security Perimeter</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2011/10/canada-pursues-more-aggressive-security.html">Canada Pursues U.S.-Style Security and Foreign Policy</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2011/01/deepening-canada-us-security-and.html">Deepening Canada-U.S. Security and Military Ties</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2011/06/perimeter-security-and-integrated-north.html">Perimeter Security and an Integrated North American Command</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5684932796315606818" /></a><br />After months of negotiations, the U.S. and Canada have unveiled new trade, regulatory and security initiatives to speed up the flow of goods and people across the border. The joint action plans provide a framework that goes beyond NAFTA and continues where the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) left off. This will take U.S.-Canada integration to the next level and is the pretext for a North American Homeland Security perimeter.   <br /><br />On December 7, President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced the <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/bbg-tpf/perimeter-security-and-economic-competitiveness-action-plan">Beyond the Border Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness Action Plan</a>. The new deal focuses on addressing security threats early, facilitating trade, economic growth and jobs, integrating cross-border law enforcement, as well as improving infrastructure and cyber-security. It will act as a roadmap with different parts being phased in over the next several years. This includes the creation of various pilot projects. Many aspects of the agreement will also depend on the availability of funding from both governments. In addition, the two leaders issued a separate <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/rcc-ccr/joint-action-plan-canada-united-states-regulatory-cooperation-council">Regulatory Cooperation Council Action Plan</a> that sets out initiatives whereby the U.S. and Canada will seek greater regulatory alignment in the areas of agriculture and food, transportation, environment, health, along with consumer products. <a name='more'></a> <br /><br />At a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/12/07/statements-president-barack-obama-and-prime-minister-canada-stephen-harp">Joint News Conference</a>, President Obama declared that, “Canada is key to achieving my goal of doubling American exports and putting folks back to work. And the two important initiatives that we agreed to today will help us do just that.” He went on to say, “we’re agreeing to a series of concrete steps to bring our economies even closer and to improve the security of our citizens.” Obama also added, “we’re going to improve our infrastructure, we’re going to introduce new technologies, we’re going to improve cargo security and screening.” Prime Minister Harper proclaimed that, “These agreements create a new, modern order for a new century. Together, they represent the most significant steps forward in Canada-U.S. cooperation since the North American Free Trade Agreement.” He explained that, “The first agreement merges U.S. and Canadian security concerns with our mutual interest in keeping our border as open as possible to legitimate commerce and travel.” Harper described how, “The second joint initiative will reduce regulatory barriers to trade by streamlining and aligning standards.” <br /><br />Some of the measures found in the Beyond the Border action plan include conducting joint, integrated threat assessments; improving cooperative law enforcement capacity and national intelligence- and information-sharing; cooperating on research and best practices to prevent and counter homegrown violent extremism; working to jointly prepare for and respond to binational disasters and enhancing cross-border critical infrastructure protection and resilience. Other facets of the deal will work towards adopting an integrated cargo security strategy; implementing entry and exit verification; establishing and verifying the identity of foreign travellers to North America; better aligning Canadian and U.S. programs for low-risk travellers and installing radio frequency identification technology at key border crossings. <br /><br />As part of the agreement, both countries will, “implement two Next-Generation pilot projects to create integrated teams in areas such as intelligence and criminal investigations, and an intelligence-led uniformed presence between ports of entry.” This will build on past joint law enforcement initiatives such as the <a href="http://205.193.86.86/ibet-eipf/shiprider-eng.htm">Shiprider program</a> and the <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ibet-eipf/index-eng.htm">Integrated Border Enforcement Teams</a>. The Next-Generation pilot projects are scheduled to be deployed by the summer of 2012. In September,  <a href="http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/ag/speeches/2011/ag-speech-110914.html">U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder</a> revealed plans that would allow law enforcement officers to operate on both sides of the border. He announced that, “the creation of ‘NextGen’ teams of cross-designated officers would allow us to more effectively identify, assess, and interdict persons and organizations involved in transnational crime.” Holder also commented that, “In conjunction with the other provisions included in the Beyond the Border Initiative, such a move would enhance our cross-border efforts and advance our information-sharing abilities.”<br /><br />In his article, <a href="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/business/blackmailed+Canada/5827741/story.html">How the U.S. blackmailed Canada</a>, Gar Pardy stressed that as part of a North American security zone, “Canadian security institutions will be more closely integrated with those of the United States.” While addressing the Beyond the Border declaration and the subsequent action plan, he highlighted the fact that, “these are not formal treaties or even formal agreements, although there could be greater formality in the future.” Pardy also noted, “Nowhere in the documentation resulting from the two meetings are there suggestions the people of Canada will be provided with detailed information on which judgments can be made on the wisdom of this consensual agreement negotiated in the backrooms of both capitals.” Instead he cautioned that, “the troublesome details implicit in the agreement will be hidden behind the wall of national security.” Pardy argued that in the process, “Canada sold its national security independence in exchange for hoped-for minor changes to American border restrictions.” He concluded that, “It is not an overstatement to suggest the United States blackmailed the government of Canada into making this deal. It was the American way or no way.” <br /><br />The Council of Canadians have also strongly <a href="http://www.canadians.org/media/trade/2011/07-Dec-11-b.html">rejected</a> the new border deal. They have challenged the notion that, “proper privacy protections can be achieved between Canada and the U.S. without significantly diluting stronger Canadian laws and norms.” Citing privacy concerns associated with the U.S. Patriot Act, the organization emphasized that, “the proposed new entry-exit system for travellers needs the greatest scrutiny by Canadian parliamentarians, security and privacy experts.” The Council of Canadians also criticized,  “the government for hiding behind a sham public consultation and implying that this should clear the way for implementation of the action plan.” In August, the Conservative government released two reports which summarized online public input received concerning <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/rcc-ccr/summary-report-consultations-canadians-regulatory-cooperation-between-canada-and-united">regulatory cooperation</a>, as well as <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/bbg-tpf/report-consultations-perimeter-security-and-economic-competitiveness">perimeter security and economic competitiveness</a>. While improving the movement of trade and travel was the priority for business groups, many individuals expressed concerns over the loss of sovereignty, along with the protection of personal information.<br /><br />When it comes to regulatory convergence, Maude Barlow, national chairperson of the Council of Canadians agreed that, “Standardization can be a good thing when standards are high,” She conceded, “The problem is standards aren’t higher in the U.S. in many cases.” Barlow also acknowledged that, “Already Health Canada and other agencies consider harmonization with U.S. standards to be a more important consideration than the real safety of our food. This perimeter deal cements that skewed priority list.” There are fears that it could erode any independent Canadian regulatory capacity and weaken existing regulations. Part of the <a href="http://www.spp-psp.gc.ca/eic/site/spp-psp.nsf/eng/00095.html">SPP agenda</a> called for improving regulatory cooperation which resulted in Canada <a href="http://www.canada.com/topics/bodyandhealth/story.html?id=2fa3e7f8-9c83-4ea9-ad60-c13b548fe688">raising pesticide limits</a> on fruits and vegetables. Regulatory integration threatens Canadian sovereignty and democracy. Further harmonization with the U.S. could result in Canada losing control over its ability to regulate food safety. This could also lead to a race to the bottom with respect to other regulatory standards. <br /><br />By all accounts, <a href="http://canadians.org/blog/?p=12648">big business is the winner</a> in the new trade and security perimeter deal. Maude Barlow explained that, “this process has been set up to accommodate one sector of our community and that is big business.”  In advance of the action plans being unveiled to the public, business stakeholders were briefed on the specifics. The <a href="http://www.ceocouncil.ca/news-item/canada-u-s-border-action-plan-will-reduce-costs-boost-trade-and-create-jobs-ceos-say">Canadian Council of Chief Executives</a>, an organization that lobbies the government on behalf of Canada’s largest corporations has given it their stamp of approval. The U.S. and Canadian Chambers of Commerce also <a href="http://www.chamber.ca/index.php/en/media-centre/C197/u.s.-and-canadian-chambers-applaud-new-vision-for-border-regulatory-coopera/">applauded</a> the new vision for border and regulatory cooperation. When it comes to negotiations on the border security agreement, Barlow confirmed that, “the big business community was the only sector at the table with government and guided the process from the beginning.” This was also the case with the now defunct SPP. Big business was a driving force behind the initiative which led to the creation of the <a href="http://coa.counciloftheamericas.org/group.php?id=10">North American Competitiveness Council</a> to ensure that corporate interests were being addressed. <br /><br />In her article, Maude Barlow also warned that when it comes to the perimeter deal, “Canada is essentially giving up policy control in the key areas of privacy, security, immigration and surveillance in order to entice the U.S. to loosen controls at the border.” She stated, “it is likely to lead to a wholesale replacement of Canadian privacy and security standards with American ones, set by Homeland Security.” When it comes to information being collected and stored, Barlow questioned whether it will be, “used as a form of social control, to identify not terrorists, but activists and dissenters of government policy.” She insisted that, “We must call on our government to create a full public and Parliamentary debate before this deal becomes operational.” From the beginning, the whole process has lacked transparency with no congressional or parliamentary oversight. This has drawn comparisons to the SPP which was shrouded in secrecy and fueled by fears over the loss of sovereignty that finally led to its downfall. We can only hope that this latest endeavour will meet the same fate. With the 2012 U.S. election cycle about to get into full swing, the new bilateral deal could get lost in the shuffle.<br /><br />While the perimeter agreement is being sold as vital to the safety and prosperity of  Canadians and Americans alike, there is little doubt that it will mean a tradeoff between sovereignty and security. Any deal which gives the Department of Homeland Security more personal information poses a serious risk to privacy rights. As both countries move forward, perimeter security will be further defined and dominated by American interests. This could force Canada to comply with any new U.S. security measures, regardless of the dangers they may pose to civil liberties. A North American Homeland Security perimeter goes well beyond keeping people safe from any perceived threats. It is a means to secure trade, resources, as well as corporate interests and is a pretext for control over the continent. Ultimately, the U.S. wants the final say on who is allowed to enter and who is allowed to leave. <br /><br />Related articles by Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2011/09/us-canada-perimeter-security-and.html">Perimeter Security and the Consolidation of North America</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2011/02/security-perimeter-deal-would-take.html">A North American Security Perimeter Threatens Sovereignty</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2011/05/big-business-pushing-for-single-unified.html">The Push for a Single Unified North American Regulatory Regime</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2011/08/advancing-us-canada-economic-energy-and.html">Advancing U.S.-Canada Economic, Energy and Security Integration</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5679141984111803586" /></a><br />At the recent APEC meetings, Canada and Mexico announced their interest in joining the U.S., along with other countries already engaged in negotiations to establish what has been referred to as the NAFTA of the Pacific.  <br /><br />The leaders of the nine countries that are part of the <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/fact-sheets/2011/november/outlines-trans-pacific-partnership-agreement">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) met at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Hawaii and agreed on the broad outlines of  a free trade agreement. The current members include the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei, Peru and Chile. The TPP has been hailed as a, “landmark, 21st-century trade agreement, setting a new standard for global trade and incorporating next-generation issues.” Key features of the TPP are that it would provide comprehensive market access and be a fully regional agreement designed to facilitate the development of production and supply chains. Various working groups have been discussing issues such as financial services, government procurement, intellectual property, investment, rules of origin, telecommunications and trade remedies. The next round of talks will take place in December and there are hopes of concluding negotiations before the end of 2012. Apart from Canada and Mexico, Japan has also expressed interest in being part of the TPP. The door is also open for other countries to join which is why many consider it to be a building block for an Asia-Pacific free trade zone. <a name='more'></a> <br /><br />Following the APEC forum, President Barack Obama held a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Originally, it was scheduled to be a North American Leaders Summit, but Mexican President Felipe Calderon could not attend due to the death of Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora. According to a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/13/readout-press-secretary-presidents-meeting-prime-minister-harper-canada">Readout by the Press Secretary</a>, the leaders look forward to a rescheduled trilateral summit. During his meeting with Prime Minister Harper, President Obama, “noted the important progress being made on the Beyond the Border and Regulatory Cooperation initiatives.” He invited Harper to Washington in early December where an <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=3938">action plan</a> that would work towards a North American security perimeter could finally be released. Both leaders also discussed the announcement by the State Department to seek additional information regarding the <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/11/176964.htm">Keystone XL Pipeline project</a>. A final ruling on the pipeline which would carry oil from western Canada to the gulf coast of Texas will not be made until after the November 2012 presidential election. The move has prompted Canada to further diversify its trade ties and shift its focus on the Asia-Pacific region.<br /><br />The decision by <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/2011/november/statement-us-trade-representative-ron-kirk-japans">Japan to begin consultations with TPP countries</a>, followed by the news that Canada and Mexico are also seeking to join negotiations, has given the trade agreement a real boost. U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/2011/november/statement-us-trade-representative-ron-kirk-announ">welcomed</a> their interest and stated, “Along with Japan’s similar announcement this week, the desire of these North American nations to consult with TPP partners demonstrates the broadening momentum and dynamism of this ambitious effort toward economic integration across the Pacific.” Minister of International Trade Ed Fast reaffirmed Canada’s commitment to <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/media_commerce/comm/news-communiques/2011/346.aspx?lang=eng&view=d#cn-nav">advancing economic interests in the Asia-Pacific region</a>. He acknowledged, “We recognize the TPP as a means to further strengthen those ties and contribute to what promises to become a broadly-based vehicle for economic integration in the region.” The report, <a href="http://www.ceocouncil.ca/news-item/canada-must-act-quickly-to-seize-opportunities-in-asia-report-says">Canada, China, and Rising Asia: A Strategic Proposal</a> released in October, recommended joining the TPP as the most efficient way to deepen integration with other Asian economies, providing that the Canadian government reforms the supply management system. <br /><br />Canada has previously expressed interest in the TPP, but supply management has proven to be stumbling block. The practice which has been in place for decades sets production quotas for dairy, egg and poultry farmers and protects them with import tariffs. In a recent <a href="http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/opening-synlait-new-dairy-factory">speech</a>, New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser raised questions about Canada’s application to join TPP negotiations. He admitted, “Dairy will be very challenging for Canada. This is a statement of fact. Canada follows a policy that many Governments used to follow but most have moved forward. It is called ‘supply management.’ It is completely inconsistent with tariff elimination.” As far as benchmarks go, Groser confirmed that there are questions that TPP countries will ask when considering new applicants such as whether, “we see clear evidence of a matching commitment to attain a high-quality agreement across all chapters, including the most sensitive matters.” He maintained that, “There is a very strict dress code involved and we are going to be stuffy and old fashioned in enforcing it. When our Leaders said ‘eliminate’ tariffs and other direct barriers to imports, they meant it.” Some have hinted that TPP negotiations could be used to expand NAFTA.<br /><br />The Conservative government maintains that it will promote and defend Canadian interests, but there are concerns that supply management could be used as a bargaining chip to secure a spot in the TPP. In his article, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/is-harper-putting-dairy-and-poultry-protection-on-the-table-in-trade-talks/article2236349/">Is Harper putting dairy and poultry protection on the table in trade talks?</a>, Steven Chase reported that, “A former senior Canadian trade official said expanding trade with Asia is not the Harper government’s only reason for joining the Trans-Pacific talks.” He goes on to say, “John Weekes, Canada’s chief NAFTA negotiator, said Ottawa can’t afford to be left out of talks that appear to be offering signatories a deeper economic relationship with the U.S. than can be found in the North American free-trade agreement.” Weekes is also quoted as saying, “What we’re talking about here – if it really does become what Obama says it will be – is we’re renegotiating NAFTA in the same way we renegotiated the Canada-U.S. FTA.” Another NAFTA-style agreement poses a serious threat to economic sovereignty. There are fears that the U.S. could use the TPP to open up the Canadian telecom market and its banking sector to more foreign financial services. <br /><br />In his article, <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/11/14/2502452/were-neglecting-our-north-american.html">We’re neglecting our North American neighbors</a>, Robert Pastor described the TPP as a flawed strategy and stressed that the road to completing an agreement would be long. He explained Canada and Mexico’s decision to join the TPP, “as a defensive measure to ensure that they protect what they gained from NAFTA.” He also stated, “Obama should give priority to forging a seamless market with Canada and Mexico. But for the second time in two years, the North American leaders postponed their summit without setting a new date.” Pastor conceded that, “The three leaders have shown little imagination or even interest in dealing with a continental agenda.” He warned how, “the TPP will divert scarce political capital and attention from North America.”  Pastor further emphasized that, “The fastest way to create jobs and double exports is for the three governments to work together on continental plans for transportation, education, and infrastructure.” He also added, “If the TPP’s purpose is to put pressure on China to open its market, that won’t work” and instead suggested, “A reinvigorated North America is more likely to get China’s attention.” <br /><br />The article, <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1111/S00171/tpp-as-a-lynchpin-of-us-anti-china-strategy.htm">TPP as a Lynchpin of US Anti-China Strategy</a> by Jane Kelsey sheds more light as to the real agenda behind the proposed trade agreement. She acknowledged that it is part of a, “revival of US geopolitical and strategic influence in the Asian region to counter the ascent of China. The US aims to isolate and subordinate China in part through constructing a region-wide legal regime that serves the interests of, and is enforceable by, the US and its corporations.” It is interesting to note that many of the current TPP partners, including new prospective members support U.S. foreign policy initiatives. This ties in nicely with the Obama administration’s plans of expanding alliances and military bases in the Asia-Pacific region in an effort to contain China’s rising power.<br /><br />Related Articles by Dana Gabriel<br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2010/10/us-economic-political-and-military.html">U.S. Economic, Political and Military Expansion in Asia-Pacific</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2009/11/building-blocks-towards-asia-pacific.html">Building Blocks Towards an Asia-Pacific Union</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2011/11/north-american-integration-and-ties.html">North American Integration and the Ties That Bind</a><br /><a href="http://beyourownleader.blogspot.com/2011/10/canada-pursues-more-aggressive-security.html">Canada Pursues U.S.-Style Security and Foreign Policy</a><br /><br />Dana Gabriel is an activist and independent researcher.

<p>For employers, there are a whole host of advantages that come with replacing human workers with technology.  Robots and computers never complain, they never get tired, they never need vacation, they never show up late, they never waste time on Facebook, they don't need any health benefits and there are a vast array of rules, regulations and taxes that you must deal with when you hire a human worker.</p>
<p>If you could get a task done more cheaply and more efficiently by replacing a human worker with technology, why wouldn't you want to do it?</p>
<p>We are already starting to see this happen on a mass scale, and according to Dr. Frey and Dr. Osborne, close to half of all of our jobs could be automated within the next 20 years.  A recent article posted on <a href="http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/bulletin/half-of-all-us-jobs-will-be-automated-but-what-opportunities-will-be-created/29406">smartplanet.com</a> described how this process might play out...</p>
<blockquote><p>The automation of half the nation’s jobs will occur in two phases, the study says: The first wave will affect (and is affecting) jobs in transportation/logistics, production labor, administrative support, services, sales, and construction. The second wave — propelled by artificial intelligence — will affect jobs in management, science, engineering, and the arts.</p>
<p>Just as interesting as the study is the response provided by Gary Reber, founder and executive director of <a href="http://www.foreconomicjustice.org" target="_hplink">For Economic Justice</a>, who argues that owners of the means of production will actually thrive as such a shift takes place. Those who rely on 9-to-5 standard employment arrangements for subsistence are likely to  suffer the most in the automation wave. As Reber put it: ‘Full employment is not an objective of businesses. Companies strive to keep labor input and other costs at a minimum.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of the reasons why the U.S. economy will never produce enough jobs for everyone ever again.</p>
<p>If technology can outperform humans, it is only rational for companies to replace humans with technology.</p>
<p>And this is even starting to happen in fields that require very high levels of education.</p>
<p>Just look at what is happening in the medical field.  Today, millions of people turn to websites such as <a href="http://www.webmd.com/">WebMD</a> for their medical needs, but this is only just the beginning.  Check out this excerpt from a recent Bloomberg article entitled "<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-26/doctor-robot-will-see-you-shortly.html">Doctor Robot Will See You Shortly</a>"...</p>
<blockquote><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/09/26/jjs-sedasys-puts-challenge-to-anesthesiologists/" rel="external">proposes to replace</a> anesthesiologists during simple procedures such as colonoscopies -- not with nurse practitioners, but with machines. Sedasys, which dispenses propofol and monitors a patient automatically, was recently approved for use in healthy adult patients who have no particular risk of complications. Johnson &amp; Johnson will lease the machines to doctor’s offices for $150 per procedure -- cleverly set well below the $600 to $2,000 that anesthesiologists usually charge.</p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly we will always need doctors.</p>
<p>But many of the tasks that doctors once performed will now be performed by technology.</p>
<p>For example, have you heard about "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/x-prize-foundation/exponential-health-techno_b_3991485.html">OnStar for the Body</a>" yet?  Some of these new "wearable technologies" are more than a little bit creepy...</p>
<blockquote><p>Smart, cheaper and point-of-care sensors, such as those being developed for the <a href="http://www.nokiasensingxchallenge.org/">Nokia Sensing XCHALLENGE</a>, will further enable the 'Digital Checkup' from anywhere. The world of 'Quantified Self' and 'Quantified Health' will lead to a new generation of wearable technologies partnered with <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/watson_in_healthcare.shtml">Artificial Intelligence</a> that will help decipher and make this information actionable.</p>
<p>And this 'actionability' is key. We hear the term Big Data used in various contexts; when applied to health information it will likely be the smart integration of massive data sets from the 'Internet of things' with the small data about your activity, mood, and other information. When properly filtered, this data set can give insights on a macro level - population health - and micro - '<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BhbMPKcOnY">OnStar for the Body</a>' with a personalized 'check engine light' to help identify individual problems before they further develop into expensive, difficult-to-treat or fatal conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>We are also seeing humans being replaced in other fields as well.  For instance, <a href="http://fcw.com/articles/2013/09/26/6-sci-fi-darpa-projects.aspx">DARPA</a> has developed a robot named "Atlas" that it hopes will be used in "disaster-response scenarios"...</p>
<blockquote><p>DARPA's Virtual Robotics Challenge entered a new phase in July, when Atlas — a 6-foot-2-inch, 330-pound robot developed by Boston Dynamics — was introduced to seven teams tasked with training it for disaster-response scenarios. The end goal? "Supervised autonomy" so that Atlas and its successors can step into situations too dangerous for humans.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't know about you, but I don't really want "Terminator" to show up when my family is in the middle of a disaster, but this is where things are headed.</p>
<p>And as technology increases, a lot of good paying middle class jobs are going to be vulnerable.  In fact, <a title="recent study of employment data" href="http://news.yahoo.com/practically-human-smart-machines-job-052642993--finance.html" target="_blank">one study of employment data</a> that examined statistics from 20 countries found that "almost all the jobs disappearing are in industries that pay middle-class wages, ranging from $38,000 to $68,000."</p>
<p>Those are exactly the sort of "breadwinner jobs" that middle class families <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-decline-of-breadwinner-jobs-has-resulted-in-the-longest-bread-lines-in-american-history">rely upon</a>.</p>
<p>And of course working class jobs are being replaced by technology as well.  According to <a title="MIT Technology Review" href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/509296/small-factories-give-baxter-the-robot-a-cautious-once-over/?utm_campaign=newsletters&amp;utm_source=newsletter-weekly-business&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20130118" target="_blank">MIT Technology Review</a>, a $22,000 humanoid robot named Baxter has been developed that can easily be programmed to do jobs that have never been automated before...</p>
<blockquote><p>Brooks’s company, Rethink Robotics, says the robot will spark a “renaissance” in American manufacturing by helping small companies compete against low-wage offshore labor. Baxter will do that by accelerating a trend of factory efficiency that’s eliminated more jobs in the U.S. than overseas competition has. Of the approximately 5.8 million manufacturing jobs the U.S. lost between 2000 and 2010, according to McKinsey Global Institute, two-thirds were lost because of higher productivity and only 20 percent moved to places like China, Mexico, or Thailand.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is for robots like Baxter to take over more complex tasks, such as fitting together parts on an electronics assembly line. “A couple more ticks of Moore’s Law and you’ve got automation that works more cheaply than Chinese labor does,” Andrew McAfee, an MIT researcher, predicted last year at a conference in Tucson, Arizona, where Baxter was discussed.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what are human workers going to do when robots are making all of our products?</p>
<p>That is a very good question.</p>
<p>Incredibly, robots are now even replacing human factory workers in China.  The following comes from a recent <a title="TechCrunch article" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/foxconn-allegedly-replacing-human-workers-with-robots/?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed" target="_blank">TechCrunch article</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>Foxconn <a title="has been planning to buy 1 million robots" href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/01/foxconn-planning-to-hire-1-million-robots/" target="_blank">has been planning to buy 1 million robots</a> to replace human workers and it looks like that change, albeit gradual, is about to start.</p>
<p>The company is allegedly paying $25,000 per robot – about three times a worker’s average salary – and they will replace humans in assembly tasks. The plans have been in place for a while – I spoke to <a title="Foxconn reps about this a year ago" href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/future-of-foxconn/" target="_blank">Foxconn reps about this a year ago</a> – and it makes perfect sense. Humans are messy, they want more money, and having a half-a-million of them in one factory is a recipe for unrest. But what happens after the halls are clear of careful young men and women and instead full of whirring robots?</p></blockquote>
<p>So who benefits from all of this?</p>
<p>Those that own the big corporations that dominate our economy certainly benefit.  They aren't going to need to hire as many of us to work for them, and they are going to make even bigger profits than before.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a title="gap between the rich and the poor" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-u-s-has-an-even-larger-gap-between-the-rich-and-the-poor-than-downton-abbey-does">gap between the wealthy and the poor</a> will grow even larger.  The only thing that most people have to offer in the economic marketplace is their labor, and the demand for that labor is decreasing with each passing day.</p>
<p>What do you think will happen to society when most of us are no longer "needed"?</p>
<p>Could we be headed for big trouble as a society?</p>
<p>And if you think that your job could "never be automated", you might want to think again.</p>
<p>We are rapidly getting to the point <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323808204579085271065923340.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories">where even driving will be automated</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>Brace yourself. In a few years, your car will be able to drop you off at the door of a shopping center or airport terminal, go park itself and return when summoned with a smartphone app. Audi demonstrated such a system at this year's Consumer Electronics Show.</p>
<p>At your next dinner party, ask for a show of hands of the people who'd want that.</p>
<p>Everybody?</p>
<p>Anybody want a car that doesn't crash? At this month's Frankfurt auto show, mega-auto supplier Continental announced a partnership with <span class="companyRollover link11unvisited">IBM</span> to help bring autonomous vehicles to market, with "zero accidents" as a possible result. Volvo has promised to injury-proof its cars by 2020. GM and Carnegie Mellon aim to develop autonomous technology to eliminate car accidents.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what will happen to the <a title="3.1 million Americans" href="http://news.yahoo.com/practically-human-smart-machines-job-052642993--finance.html" target="_blank">3.1 million Americans</a> that drive trucks for a living once all driving is automated?</p>
<p>What will happen to the millions of other Americans that drive buses, taxis and limos once all driving is automated?</p>
<p>That is something to think about.</p>
<p>And researchers are even trying to create computers that <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/economics/2013/09/man-who-wants-total-unemployment-all-human-beings-world">"seem human"</a> when you have a conversation with them...</p>
<blockquote><p>On 14 September, researchers will <a href="http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html" target="_blank">gathered in Derry, Northern Ireland</a>, to demonstrate their latest efforts. If any of them has created a machine that successfully mimics a human, they will leave $100,000 richer.</p>
<p>The money is being put up by Hugh Loebner, a New York based philanthropist. His goal, he says, is total unemployment for all human beings throughout the world. He wants robots to do all the work. And the first step towards that is apparently to develop computers that seem human when you chat to them.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if your job involves a telephone, you are in danger of being phased out.  In fact, this transition is <a title="talking to a robot" href="http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569573-attractions-employing-robots-rise-software-machines" target="_blank">already starting to happen</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>IPsoft is a young company started by Chetan Dube, a former mathematics professor at New York University. He reckons that artificial intelligence can take over most of the routine information-technology and business-process tasks currently performed by workers in offshore locations. “The last decade was about replacing labour with cheaper labour,” says Mr Dube. “The coming decade will be about replacing cheaper labour with autonomics.”</p>
<p>IPsoft’s Eliza, a “virtual service-desk employee” that learns on the job and can reply to e-mail, answer phone calls and hold conversations, is being tested by several multinationals. At one American media giant she is answering 62,000 calls a month from the firm’s information-technology staff. She is able to solve two out of three of the problems without human help. At IPsoft’s media-industry customer Eliza has replaced India’s Tata Consulting Services.</p></blockquote>
<p>We truly are entering an unprecedented time in human history.</p>
<p>Instead of robots violently taking over society like so many movies have portrayed, they are slowly starting to "replace" us instead.  A recent <a title="Wired article" href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/12/ff-robots-will-take-our-jobs/all/" target="_blank">Wired article</a> described what this transition might look like as it picks up steam...</p>
<blockquote><p>First, machines will consolidate their gains in already-automated industries. After robots finish replacing assembly line workers, they will replace the workers in warehouses. Speedy bots able to lift 150 pounds all day long will retrieve boxes, sort them, and load them onto trucks. Fruit and vegetable picking will continue to be robotized until no humans pick outside of specialty farms. Pharmacies will feature a single pill-dispensing robot in the back while the pharmacists focus on patient consulting. Next, the more dexterous chores of cleaning in offices and schools will be taken over by late-night robots, starting with easy-to-do floors and windows and eventually getting to toilets. The highway legs of long-haul trucking routes will be driven by robots embedded in truck cabs.</p>
<p>All the while, robots will continue their migration into white-collar work. We already have artificial intelligence in many of our machines; we just don’t call it that. Witness one piece of software by Narrative Science (profiled in issue 20.05) that can write newspaper stories about sports games directly from the games’ stats or generate a synopsis of a company’s stock performance each day from bits of text around the web. Any job dealing with reams of paperwork will be taken over by bots, including much of medicine. Even those areas of medicine not defined by paperwork, such as surgery, are becoming increasingly robotic. The rote tasks of any information-intensive job can be automated. It doesn’t matter if you are a doctor, lawyer, architect, reporter, or even programmer: The robot takeover will be epic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are you ready for the "robot takeover"?</p>
<p>The world of employment is never going to be the same again.  Technology has already surpassed human workers in a whole host of arenas, and this transition is only going to become more rapid in the years ahead.</p>

<p>There have already been widespread reports of companies dropping health insurance, but nobody knows for sure how widespread the carnage will be.  According to <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-08/why-your-employer-may-drop-your-health-care-plan">Businessweek</a>, the surveys that have been done up to this point have come up with widely varying results...</p>
<blockquote><p>A Deloitte study last year suggested <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443437504577545770682810842.html">10 percent</a> of employers would stop offering group health plans. A widely criticized McKinsey report from 2011 put the number <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/business/21insure.html">as high as one-third</a>. The Congressional Budget Office’s latest projections suggest <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43900">8 million</a> fewer people will be covered by employer plans five years from now under the ACA than without it. Many of them will get policies through health insurance exchanges instead.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what everyone does agree on is that employer-based health coverage will continue to diminish.</p>
<p>And we are already watching this happen right in front of our eyes.  Just this week, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304795804579097422592424860.html">the Wall Street Journal</a> reported that the largest security guard firm in the United States is dropping health coverage for 55,000 employees...</p>
<blockquote><p>The nation's largest provider of security guards plans to discontinue its lowest-cost health plans and steer roughly 55,000 workers to new government-sponsored insurance exchanges for coverage next year, in the latest sign of the fraying ties between employment and health care.</p>
<p>The U.S. arm of Sweden's Securitas AB is among more than 1,200 employers that offer the kind of bare-bones health plans that must be phased out beginning Jan. 1 under the health-care law. Nearly four million people are enrolled in these so-called mini-med plans, which cap benefits to participants, sometimes at as little as $3,000 a year.</p>
<p>"The mini-meds go away and we're not replacing them," said Jim McNulty, a spokesman for Securitas's U.S. operation. "Their option is to go to the exchanges."</p>
<p>Other big employers, including Darden Restaurants Inc., Home Depot Inc. and Trader Joe's Co., say they will stop offering health insurance to part-time workers, and will direct those employees to the state exchanges. Darden, Home Depot and Trader Joe's previously offered mini-meds to their part timers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking of Trader Joe's, I wrote about how they are eliminating health coverage for part-time workers <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/percentage-of-americans-that-consider-themselves-to-be-lower-class-is-at-an-all-time-high">the other day</a>.  Instead of providing health insurance for their part-time workers, Trader Joe's <a title="what Trader Joe's is doing" href="http://fairfaxcity.patch.com/groups/business-news/p/trader-joes-kicks-part-timers-off-healthcare-plan_a2977162" target="_blank">will be writing them a check and pushing them on to the Obamacare exchanges</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>Trader Joe's, the grocer once lauded for providing health care coverage to its part-time workers, is about to push those employees off its plan.</p>
<p>According to <a title="a memo obtained by the Huffington Post" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/11/trader-joes-obamacare_n_3902341.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a memo obtained by the <i>Huffington Post</i></a>, the company will stop covering employees who work less than 30 hours per week.</p>
<p>The change is set for the start of 2014. Instead of insurance, workers instead will get a check for $500 in January.<br />
<i><br />
</i>"Depending on income you may earn outside of Trader Joe's, we believe that with the $500 from Trader Joe's and the tax credits available under the [Affordable Care Act (ACA)], many of you should be able to obtain health care coverage at very little if any net cost to you," said Trader Joe CEO Dan Bane in the memo.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this is a huge reason why the shift from full-time work to part-time work in America has accelerated this year.  Obamacare creates an incentive for companies to have more part-time workers and less full-time workers.  In fact, almost all of the jobs that have been "created" by the U.S. economy in 2013 <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-number-of-private-sector-jobs-fell-by-278000-last-month-but-the-economy-is-getting-better">have been part-time jobs</a>.</p>
<p>But it is incredibly difficult to try to support a family on a part-time job.  Sadly, <a title="the quality of our jobs" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/15-signs-that-the-quality-of-jobs-in-america-is-going-downhill-really-fast">the quality of our jobs</a> continues to decline rapidly and only <a title="47 percent" href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/05/only-47-americans-have-full-time-job" target="_blank">47 percent</a> of all adults have a full-time job in America today.  This is only going to continue to get even worse under Obamacare.</p>
<p>As a result of these trends, more Americans are going to be forced to go out and buy health insurance "on the individual market".  When they do, they are likely to be in for a really <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/24/one-man-obamacare-nightmare/">nasty surprise</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>Andy and Amy Mangione of Louisville, Ky. and their two boys are just the kind of people who should be helped by ObamaCare. But they recently got a nasty surprise in the mail.</p>
<p>"When I saw the letter when I came home from work," Andy said, describing the large red wording on the envelope from his insurance carrier, "(it said) 'your action required, benefit changes, act now.' Of course I opened it immediately."</p>
<p>It had stunning news. Insurance for the Mangiones and their two boys,which they bought on the individual market, was going to almost triple in 2014 --- from $333 a month to $965.</p>
<p>The insurance carrier made it clear the increase was in order to be compliant with the new health care law.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are you ready to have your health insurance premiums potentially double or triple?</p>
<p>In other cases, families are discovering that health insurance companies are simply <a href="http://onenewsnow.com//perspectives/michelle-malkin/2013/09/25/obama-lied-my-health-plan-died">cancelling their health insurance plans</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>Across the country, insurers are sending out ObamaCare-induced health plan death notices to untold tens of thousands of other customers in the individual market. Twitter users are posting their ObamaCare cancellation notices and accompanying rate increases:</p>
<p>Linda Deright posted her letter from Regency of Washington state: "63 percent jump, old policy of 15 yrs. cancelled." Karen J. Dugan wrote: "Received same notice from Blue Shield CA for our small business. Driving into exchange and no info since online site is down." Chris Birk wrote: "Got notice from BCBS that my current health plan is not ACA compliant. New plan 2x as costly for worse coverage." Small-business owner Villi Wilson posted his letter from HMSA Blue Cross Blue Shield canceling his individual plan and added: "I thought Obama said if I like my health care plan I can keep my health care plan."</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, this even happened to one member of Congress.  <a href="http://onenewsnow.com//perspectives/michelle-malkin/2013/09/25/obama-lied-my-health-plan-died">U.S. Representative Cory Gardner</a> had purchased health insurance on his own because he wanted to experience what his constituents were going through, and he recently got a letter informing him that his old plan had been "discontinued"...</p>
<blockquote><p>"After my current plan is discontinued," he wrote last week, "the closest comparable plan through our current provider will cost over 100 percent more, going from roughly $650 a month to $1,480 per month." He now carries his ObamaCare cancellation notice with him as hardcore proof of the Democrats' ultimate deception.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this what Obama was talking about when he promised that we could keep our old health insurance plans if we were happy with them?</p>
<p>In the end, millions upon millions of us are going to get pushed on to the Obamacare health insurance exchanges.</p>
<p>We were promised that there would be lots of competition and that prices would be reasonable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in some areas of the country it turns out that the "exchanges" are turning out to be "monopolies" where consumers <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/26/congresswoman-obamacare-creating-health-insurance-monopolies/">will only have one company to choose from</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>“Although seven insurance companies currently operate in North Carolina, under the new Obamacare exchanges, those options will dwindle down to one in the majority of counties,” Ellmers said Thursday following the disclosure of figures by federal health officials showing that more than 60 percent of North Carolina counties will have only one insurance provider option under Obamacare: Blue Cross Blue Shield.</p>
<p>“The whole point of an online marketplace was to provide options, so North Carolinians could go online, compare prices, and choose plans from different companies. That is how competition is supposed to work!,” Ellmers said.</p>
<p>Beginning October 1 under Obamacare, Blue Cross Blue Shield will be the only health insurance provider serving the entire state of North Carolina in the new Obamacare exchanges, serving all 100 of the state’s counties. Its competitor Coventry Health Care, which is owned by Aetna, will only reach 39 counties.</p>
<p>That leaves 61 counties, or 61 percent of all the state’s counties, in a Blue Cross Blue Shield-only zone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only that, but a lot of these exchanges are not even going to be ready to function properly on October 1st.  For example, according to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/25/d-c-s-obamacare-fail-prices-wont-work-until-november/">the Washington Post</a>, the D.C. "health marketplace" is a complete and total mess at this point...</p>
<blockquote><p>Just days away from launch, the District of Columbia's health marketplace is announcing a pretty significant delay.</p>
<p>While the D.C. Health Link will launch a Web site on October 1, shoppers will not have access to the their premium prices until mid-November. The delay comes after the District marketplace discovered "a high error rate" in calculating the tax credits that low- and middle-income people will use to purchase insurance on the marketplace.</p>
<p>The insurance marketplaces, if working as plan, are supposed to spit out an estimate for a tax credit after a shopper enters in some basic information about where she lives and how much she earns. In the District, that won't happen next month. Instead, the eligibility determination will be made "off-line by experts" by early November.</p></blockquote>
<p>So who is going to benefit from this new system?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that the health insurance companies will greatly benefit.  Health insurance companies helped write Obamacare, and their stock prices have <strong>absolutely soared</strong> since Obamacare was signed into law.  If you doubt this, just check out the amazing charts in <a href="http://www.infowars.com/insurance-giants-that-wrote-and-lobbied-for-health-law-cash-in/">this article</a>.</p>
<p>Not that they were hurting under the old system either.  They have been raking in gigantic mountains of cash for years while trying to provide as little health care as possible.  For much more on this, please see my previous article entitled "<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/50-signs-that-the-u-s-health-care-system-is-a-gigantic-money-making-scam-that-is-about-to-collapse">50 Signs That The U.S. Health Care System Is A Gigantic Money Making Scam</a>".</p>
<p>For the rest of us, Obamacare is going to be even worse than the old system.  A <a href="https://www.instant.ly/report/52386bb2e4b0c02bc208a937" target="_blank">2013 Health Care Survey</a> that polled 200 top health care professionals <a href="http://m.washingtonexaminer.com/19-of-health-care-pros-say-americans-will-die-earlier-due-to-obamacare/article/2536481">discovered the following</a> about what they believe Obamacare will bring...</p>
<blockquote><p>-- 53 percent, “Quality of health insurance policies will suffer.”</p>
<p>-- 51 percent, “Quality of care will go down.”</p>
<p>-- 49 percent, “The law is overly complicated.”</p>
<p>-- 42 percent, “Insurance exchanges will be poorly managed.”</p>
<p>-- 37 percent, “The law still allows insurance companies to be the middleman.”</p>
<p>-- 32 percent, “Too complex for businesses.”</p>
<p>-- 19 percent, “Americans will die earlier.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So Americans are going to pay more, get worse care, have more paperwork and a more complicated system, and they are likely to die younger too?</p>
<p>Wow, that sounds like a great deal.</p>
<p>Where do we sign up?</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/supercuts_707691.html?page=2">the Weekly Standard</a>, an absolutely insane amount of money is being spent on the "hair care needs" of U.S. Senators...</p>
<blockquote><p>Senate Hair Care Services has cost taxpayers about $5.25 million over 15 years. They foot the bill of more than $40,000 for the shoeshine attendant last fiscal year. Six barbers took in more than $40,000 each, including nearly $80,000 for the head barber.</p></blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that there are only 100 U.S. Senators, and many of them don't have much hair left at this point.</p>
<p>But hair care is just the tip of the iceberg.  The following are 21 other ways that our politicians are living the high life at your expense...</p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> According to <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/50richest/the-50-richest-members-of-congress-112th-2012.html">Roll Call's annual survey of Congressional wealth</a>, the super wealthy in Congress just continue to get much wealthier even though they are supposedly dedicating their lives to "public service"...</p>
<blockquote><p>Rep. <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/members/19182.html">Michael McCaul</a> (R-Texas) is the richest Member of Congress for the second year in a row, reporting a vast fortune that in 2011 had a minimum net worth surpassing $300 million for the first time.</p>
<p>McCaul is followed by Sen. <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/members/225.html">John Kerry</a> (D-Mass.), who reported a minimum net worth of $198.65 million, and Rep. <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/members/3088.html">Darrell Issa</a> (R-Calif.), who reported a minimum net worth of $140.55 million. The two lawmakers swapped places since last year's list.</p>
<p>The lawmakers who round out the top five, Sens. <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/members/2693.html">Mark Warner</a> (D-Va.) and <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/members/538.html">Jay Rockefeller</a> (D-W.Va.), also flipped positions from 2010 to 2011, with Warner's reported minimum worth rising about $9 million to $85.81 million and Rockefeller's minimum worth rising slightly to $83.08 million.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#2</strong> Amazingly, the <strong>50th</strong> most wealthy member of Congress has a net worth of <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/50richest/the-50-richest-members-of-congress-112th-2012.html">6.14 million dollars</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> At this point, more than half of those "serving the American people" in Congress <a title="are millionaires" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/40233691" target="_blank">are millionaires</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> In one recent year, an average of <a title="$4,005,900" href="http://realitybloger.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/the-senate-how-much-does-it-cost/" target="_blank">$4,005,900</a> of U.S. taxpayer money was spent on "personal" and "office" expenses <strong>per U.S. Senator</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> Once they leave Washington, former members of Congress continue to collect huge checks <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/29/retirement/congress-pension/index.html?iid=Lead">for the rest of their lives</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2011, 280 former lawmakers who retired under a former government pension system received average annual pensions of $70,620, according to a <a href="http://cnnmon.ie/15YXFa0" target="_blank">Congressional Research Service report.</a> They averaged around 20 years of service. At the same time, another 215 retirees (elected in 1984 or later with an average of 15 years of service) received average annual checks of roughly $40,000 a year.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#6</strong> Speaker of the House John Boehner would bring home a yearly pension of <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/29/retirement/congress-pension/index.html?iid=Lead">close to $85,000</a> if he left Congress when his current term ends in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> At this point, quite a few former lawmakers are collecting federal pensions for life worth <a href="http://www.allgov.com/news/top-stories/thousands-of-federal-retirees-receive-100000-a-year-pensionsincluding-newt-gingrich?news=843922">at least $100,000 annually</a>.  That list includes such notable names as Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole, Trent Lott, Dick Gephardt and Dick Cheney.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> The U.S. government is spending approximately <a title="3.6 million dollars" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/3-6-million-taxpayer-dollars-being-used-to-support-the-lavish-lifestyles-of-former-presidents-such-as-bush-and-clinton" target="_blank">3.6 million dollars</a> a year to support the lavish lifestyles of former presidents such as George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> Nearly 500,000 federal employees now make <a title="at least $100,000 a year" href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/08/20/Federal-workers-earn-twice-as-much-as-private-workers" target="_blank">at least $100,000 a year</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> During one recent year, the <strong>average</strong> federal employee in the Washington D.C. area received total compensation <a title="worth more than $126,000 a year" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-19/beltway-earnings-make-u-s-capital-richer-than-silicon-valley.html" target="_blank">worth more than $126,000</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> During one recent year, compensation for federal employees came to a grand total of <a title="is approximately 447 billion dollars" href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/11/16/gop-targets-federal-pay-report-shows-wages-exploding/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+foxnews%2Fpolitics+%28Internal+-+Politics+-+Text%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" target="_blank">approximately 447 billion dollars</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#12</strong> If you can believe it, there are <a title="77,000 federal workers" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/post/report-77000-feds-earn-more-than-governors/2011/03/23/AGLmuUGH_blog.html" target="_blank">77,000 federal workers</a> that make more than the governors of their own states do.</p>
<p><strong>#13</strong> When Joe Biden and his staff took a trip to London, the hotel bill cost U.S. taxpayers <a title="$459,388.65" href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/biden-pays-45938865-hotel-bill_708795.html" target="_blank">$459,388.65</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#14</strong> Joe Biden and his staff also stopped in Paris for one night.  The hotel bill for that one night came to <a title="$585,000.50" href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/bidens-one-night-paris-hotel-tab-58500050_708799.html" target="_blank">$585,000.50</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#15</strong> When Biden and his staff visited Moscow for two days in 2011, the total hotel bill came to <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/high-cost-vip-travel-bidens-665545-hotel-bill-moscow-obamas-450000-warsaw-tab_738138.html">$665,445.00</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#16</strong> During 2012, the salaries of Barack Obama’s three climate change advisers combined came to a grand total of <a title="more than $370,000" href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/11/dozens-wh-senior-staffers-making-six-figure-salary-amid-sequester-woes/" target="_blank">more than $370,000</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#17</strong> Overall, 139 different White House staffers were making <a title="at least $100,000" href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/11/dozens-wh-senior-staffers-making-six-figure-salary-amid-sequester-woes/" target="_blank">at least $100,000</a> during 2012, and there were 20 staffers that made the maximum of <a title="$172,200" href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/11/dozens-wh-senior-staffers-making-six-figure-salary-amid-sequester-woes/" target="_blank">$172,200</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#18</strong> It is estimated that the trip that the Obamas took to Africa cost U.S. taxpayers <a title="$100,000,000" href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/18/first-family-trip-to-africa-projected-to-cost-up-to-100m-sparking-criticism/" target="_blank">about 100 million dollars</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#19</strong> The Obamas only have one dog named "Bo", but the White House "dog handler" reportedly makes <a title="$102,000" href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/09/26/taxpayers-spent-1-4-billion-on-obama-family-last-year-perks-questioned-in-new-book/2/" target="_blank">$102,000</a> per year and sometimes he is even flown to where the Obamas are vacationing so that he can take care of the dog.</p>
<p><strong>#20</strong> There is always <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/09/26/taxpayers-spent-1-4-billion-on-obama-family-last-year-perks-questioned-in-new-book/?print=1">at least one projectionist</a> at the White House 24 hours a day just in case there is someone that wants to watch a movie.  Apparently turning on a DVD player is too much to ask.</p>
<p><strong>#21</strong> In one recent year, <a title="more than 1.4 billion dollars a year" href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/us-taxpayers-spent-1-4-billion-on-the-obamas-in-2012-british-taxpayers-only-spent-57-8-million-on-the-entire-royal-family" target="_blank">more than 1.4 <strong>billion</strong> dollars</a> was spent on the Obamas.  Meanwhile, British taxpayers only spent about 58 million dollars on the entire royal family.</p>
<p>So who pays for all of this extravagance?</p>
<p>The American people do of course.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what most of our politicians fail to understand is that most families are <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/20-ordinary-americans-talk-about-the-economic-despair-that-is-growing-like-a-cancer-all-around-them">struggling tremendously</a> right now.</p>
<p>This week, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/77-prepares-burgers-earning-week-040100515.html">Yahoo</a> featured the story of a 77-year-old former executive that is now flipping burgers and serving drinks to make ends meet.  He says that he now earns in a week what he once earned in a single hour, but he is thankful to have a job in this economic environment...</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1380041526571_599">It seems like another life. At the height of his corporate career, Tom Palome was pulling in a salary in the low six-figures and flying first class on business trips to Europe.</p>
<p>Today, the 77-year-old former vice president of marketing for Oral-B juggles two part-time jobs: one as a $10-an-hour food demonstrator at Sam's Club, the other flipping burgers and serving drinks at a golf club grill for slightly more than minimum wage.</p>
<p>While Palome worked hard his entire career, paid off his mortgage and put his kids through college, like most Americans he didn't save enough for retirement. Even many affluent baby boomers who are approaching the end of their careers haven't come close to saving the 10 to 20 times their annual working income that investment experts say they'll need to maintain their standard of living in old age.</p></blockquote>
<p>So many Americans are barely making it from month to month at this point.  Most people work very, very hard for their money, and it is very discouraging to see our politicians waste our hard-earned tax dollars so frivolously.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are signs that the American people are starting to get fed up with all of this.  According to a stunning new Gallup survey, more Americans than ever before (<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/164591/americans-belief-gov-powerful-record-level.aspx">60 percent</a>) believe that the federal government has too much power.</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p>Do you think that the government is too big and too wasteful?</p>

<p>Let's take a look at a few of the examples of how Cyprus-style wealth confiscation is now moving forward all over the globe...</p>
<p><strong>Poland</strong></p>
<p>For years, there have been rumors that someday the U.S. government would raid private pension funds.</p>
<p>Well, in Poland <strong>it just happened</strong>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/04/poland-pensions-idUSL6N0H02UV20130904">Reuters</a>, private pension funds were raided in order to reduce the size of the government debt...</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="articleText">Poland said on Wednesday it will transfer to the state many of the assets held by private pension funds, slashing public debt but putting in doubt the future of the multi-billion-euro funds, many of them foreign-owned.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The Polish government is doing the best that it can to make this sound like some sort of complicated legal maneuver, but the truth is that what they have done is stolen private assets without giving any compensation in return...</p>
<blockquote><p>The Polish pension funds' organisation said the changes may be unconstitutional because the government <strong>is taking private assets away from them without offering any compensation</strong>.</p>
<p>Announcing the long-awaited overhaul of state-guaranteed pensions, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said private funds within the state-guaranteed system would have their bond holdings transferred to a state pension vehicle, but keep their equity holdings.</p>
<p>He said that what remained in citizens' pension pots in the private funds will be gradually transferred into the state vehicle over the last 10 years before savers hit retirement age.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Iceland</strong></p>
<p>For years, Iceland has been applauded for how they handled the last financial crisis.  But now it is being proposed that the "blanket guarantee" that currently applies to all bank accounts should <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/print/479265">be reduced to 100,000 euros</a>.  Will this open the door for "haircuts" to be applied to bank account balances above that amount?...</p>
<blockquote><p>Following the crisis in October 2008, Iceland's government declared all deposits in domestic financial institutions were 'blanket' guaranteed - an Emergency Act that was reafrmed twice since. However, according to RUV, the finance minister is proposing to <strong>restrict this guarantee to only deposits less-than-EUR100,000</strong>. While some might see the removal of an 'emergency' measure as a positive, it is of course <strong>sadly reminiscent of the European Union "template" to haircut large depositors</strong>. This is coincidental (threatening) timing given the current stagnation of talks between Iceland bank creditors and the government over haircuts and lifting capital controls - which have restricted the outflows of around $8 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Europe</strong></p>
<p>European finance ministers have agreed to a plan that would make "bail-ins" the standard procedure for rescuing "too big to fail" banks in the future.  The following is how <a title="CNN" href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/27/news/world/eu-bank-rescue/index.html?iid=HP_River" target="_blank">CNN</a> described this plan...</p>
<blockquote><p>European Union finance ministers approved a plan Thursday for dealing with future bank bailouts, forcing bondholders and shareholders to take the hit for bank rescues ahead of taxpayers.</p>
<p>The new framework requires bondholders, shareholders and large depositors with over 100,000 euros to be first to suffer losses when banks fail. Depositors with less than 100,000 euros will be protected. Taxpayer funds would be used only as a last resort.</p></blockquote>
<p>What this means is that if you have over 100,000 euros in a bank account in Europe, you could lose every single bit of the unprotected amount if your bank collapses.</p>
<p><strong>Italy</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-09-23/it-begins-monte-paschi-bails-bondholders-halts-650-million-coupon-payments">Zero Hedge</a> reported on Tuesday, a "bail-in" is now being organized for the oldest bank in Italy...</p>
<blockquote><p>Recall that three weeks ago we warned that "<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-09-09/monti-paschi-faces-bail-capital-needs-point-nationalization">Monti Paschi Faces Bail-In As Capital Needs Point To Nationalization</a>" although we left open the question of "who will get the haircut including senior bondholders and depositors.... given the small size of sub-debt in the capital structures." Today, as many expected on the day following the German elections, the dominos are finally starting to wobble, and as we predicted, Monte Paschi, Italy's oldest and according to many, most insolvent bank, quietly commenced a bondholder "bail in" after it said that it suspended interest payments on three hybrid notes following demands by European authorities that bondholders contribute to the restructuring of the bailed out Italian lender. Remember what Diesel-BOOM said about Cyprus - <em>that it is a template</em>? He wasn't joking.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-23/monte-paschi-halts-coupon-payments-on-three-subordinated-notes.html">Bloomberg reports</a>, Monte Paschi "said in a statement that it won’t pay interest on about 481 million euros ($650 million) of outstanding hybrid notes issued through MPS Capital Trust II and Antonveneta Capital Trusts I and II." Why these notes? Because hybrid bondholders have zero protections and zero recourse. "<strong>Under the terms of the undated notes, the Siena, Italy-based lender is allowed to suspend interest without defaulting and doesn’t have to make up the missed coupons when payments resume.</strong>" Then again hybrids, to quote the Dutchman, are just the template for the balance of the bank's balance sheet.</p>
<p>Why is this happening now? Simple: the Merkel reelection is in the bag, and the EURUSD is too high (recall <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-09-19/european-second-half-recovery-indefinitely-postponed-adidas-cuts-forecast">Adidas' laments from last week</a>). Furthermore, if the ECB proceeds with another LTRO as many believe it will, it will force the EURUSD even higher, surging from even more unwanted liquidity. So what to do? Why stage a small, contained crisis of course. Such as a bail in by a major Italian bank. The good news for now is that depositors are untouched. Unfortunately, with depositor cash on the wrong end of the (un)secured liability continuum it is only a matter of time before those with uninsured deposits share some of the Cypriot pain. After all, in the brave New Normal insolvent world, "it is only fair."</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, it does not appear that this particular bail-in will hit private bank accounts (at least for now), but it does show that European officials are very serious about applying bail-in procedures when a major bank fails.</p>
<p><strong>New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand government has been discussing implementing a "bail-in" system to deal with any future major bank failures.  The following comes <a href="http://www.voxy.co.nz/politics/national-planning-cyprus-style-solution-greens/5/150410">from a New Zealand news source</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>The National Government are pushing a Cyprus-style solution to bank failure in New Zealand which will see <strong>small depositors lose some of their savings to fund big bank bailouts</strong>, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Open Bank Resolution (OBR) is Finance Minister Bill English’s favoured option dealing with a major bank failure. If a bank fails under OBR, all depositors will have their savings reduced overnight to fund the bank’s bail out.</p>
<p>"Bill English is proposing a <strong>Cyprus-style solution</strong> for managing bank failure here in New Zealand - a solution that will see small depositors lose some of their savings to fund big bank bailouts," said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.</p>
<p>"The Reserve Bank is in the final stages of implementing a system of managing bank failure called Open Bank Resolution. The scheme will put all bank depositors on the hook for bailing out their bank.</p>
<p>"Depositors will overnight have their savings shaved by the amount needed to keep the bank afloat."</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Canada</strong></p>
<p>Incredibly, even Canada is moving toward adopting these "bank bail-ins".  In a <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/cyprus-style-bank-account-confiscation-is-in-the-new-canadian-government-budget">previous article</a>, I explained that "bail-ins" were even part of the new Canadian government budget...</p>
<blockquote><p>Cyprus-style "bail-ins" are actually proposed in the new Canadian government budget.  When I first heard about this I was quite skeptical, so I went and looked it up for myself.  And guess what?  It is right there in black and white on <a title="pages 144 and 145" href="http://www.budget.gc.ca/2013/doc/plan/budget2013-eng.pdf" target="_blank">pages 144 and 145</a> of "Economic Action Plan 2013" which the Harper government has already submitted to the House of Commons.  This new budget actually proposes "to implement a 'bail-in' regime for systemically important banks" in Canada.  "Economic Action Plan 2013" was submitted <a title="on March 21st" href="http://www.actionplan.gc.ca/en/news/harper-government-announces-date-economic-action" target="_blank">on March 21st</a>, which means that this "bail-in regime" was likely being planned long before the crisis in Cyprus ever erupted.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what does all of this mean for us?</p>
<p>It means that the governments of the world are eyeing <strong>our money</strong> as part of the solution to any future failures of major banks.</p>
<p>As a result, there is no longer any truly "safe" place to put your money.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to protect yourself is to spread your money around.  In other words, don't put all of your eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>If you have your money a bunch of different places, it is going to be much harder for the government to grab it all.</p>
<p>But if you don't listen to the warnings and you continue to keep all of your wealth in one giant pile somewhere, don't be surprised when you get wiped out in a single moment someday.</p>

<p>We are a nation that consumes far more wealth than we produce.  We are a nation that buys far more from the rest of the world than they buy from us.  We are a nation that has a "buy now, pay later" mentality.</p>
<p>As a nation, we have accumulated the largest mountain of debt in the history of the world.  40 years ago, the total amount of debt in our system (government, business and consumer) was about 2 trillion dollars.  Today, it is more than 56 trillion dollars.</p>
<p>The consequences of decades of incredibly foolish decisions are starting to catch up with us, and it is those at the bottom of the food chain that will suffer the most.</p>
<p>I could spend the rest of this article quoting 30 or 40 more statistics that show how bad things are, but today I wanted to do something different.  Today, I wanted to share some quotes from some of my readers about what they are seeing where they live.  The following are 20 quotes from ordinary Americans about the economic despair that is rapidly growing like a cancer all around us...</p>

<p>"Yes, the American economy is in the pits. I know five languages, have three degrees (including two graduate degrees), and have lived overseas for 16 years and I still can't find a job in the USA. Everything is broken in America. Maybe I should give up my American citizenship."</p>

<p>"I work for one of the banks mentioned in your article. I was in mortgages. I saw all of this coming, so several months ago I asked to get into another area of the bank and fortunately, for me, they granted by request. A lot of people are losing their jobs and there is really no prospects out there for anything else whereby the same kind of money could be made. I will make nothing near what I had been earning but am at the least grateful to be employed. This is all so sad to watch happen."</p>

<p>"As many of you already know (but maybe some new members of this blog don't) - I live in Phoenix, Arizona. Where you live here, determines (to a great extent) your economic well being. Those in the "East Valley" - Chandler, Gilbert, Scottsdale, etc - have the jobs, the opportunities and the transportation. Those in the wealthier areas of the "West Valley" also have these benefits.</p>
<p>The remainder - those who live in the older west side of town, and the south side of town - are mainly forgotten and left to struggle. Many are hard working citizens who just want a chance. Unfortunately, chance costs money, in the view of many people, and as far as the municipal government is concerned, there's no money for us. It's cheaper to let them live in a tent in the park, where the cops at least have an excuse to evict them."</p>

<p>"There is no middle class here in the Florida Panhandle. Only folks who have money are the retired and they hate everyone. They own all the antique stores [big business] and most thriving businesses and restuarants. Military is big here, they spend every dime they have on stupid stuff and taxis. Tourist are way down since the spill. Now for the good news. A major food chain here is going out of business [Food World] Another is losing 20k a month to theft. Every other property it seems is up for sale. There are tons of empty real estate [store fronts] There are thrift stores opening everywhere. People are selling goods on the streets, only to be run off by the cops. Crime is getting out of hand. Most don't go out after dark. Police are beating up the homeless at the beaches. Panhandling now is mainly younger people. Where did all the older ones go?"</p>

<p>"In my area which is SW Florida, it's been getting tighter for my customers so on a case by case basis I lower my price when they need auto repairs. I still find road signs advertising homes for sale (cash only). Many are advertised as foreclosed.</p>

<p>I've started seeing people living out of their cars. It's not a daily occurrence but I have been noticing it."</p>

<p>I have been looking after the homeless now for 4 years. Last winter I had an encounter where I was told that I could not hand out blankets and sleeping bags in the dead of winter and that I would be arrested for trespassing if "me and my friends" didn't move along.</p>
<p>So, I adopted the policy that I would pull up next to them, have them get in the car and we would go for a drive. I would find a place to pull over and give them what they needed then I would drop them off in a different place.</p>

<p>"Around where I live in the SE, things seem ok but I live in a university town. Go to some of the surrounding small towns and it is desolate. Car dealerships closed. Entire streets with abandoned stores. The only activity is a one clerk post office. I know people in our church who are a paycheck away from going over the edge or going over due to a spouse dying and losing one of their social security checks. I see grim. More homeless. A local church is feeding many more including some folks living out of their cars---lots of children. Mostly minimum wage jobs in the area. If it were not for the university and its 34,000 students, this place would look as bad as the smaller communities."</p>
<p><strong>#15</strong> <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/44-facts-about-the-death-of-the-middle-class-that-every-american-should-know">TN Gal</a>:</p>
<p>"Here in southeast TN we have jobs, mostly part-time or low wage. Our problem these days are so many people dependent on government programs no one wants to work. They do better on programs than working partying and paying for insurance. Housing still very depressed. Seeing more homeless around and local churches straining to provide food. Crime is up and drugs, which were down, are coming back with a vengeance. Middle class here are senior citizens on SS, younger retirees not the older ones. Older ones seem to be struggling. Sad."</p>

<p>Michael, I live in North Central Illinois. About 60 miles southeast of Chicago. The town we live in has about 8,000 in it. Very "middle class" farm community. Unemployment is high and so is underemployment. We know many people living off 2 part time jobs. That seems to be the norm around here. Or people taking jobs that they would never of considered in the past, just to get by. My son used to work for CAT in Aurora, but was "let go" in order to bring in new workers at a lower pay scale. It took him over a year(which really isn't bad) to find a part time job with 3M.</p>

<p>"Drive around Los Angeles at 3:00 AM any day and you will see the devastating and pervasive homelessness from 8 to 80 year olds.  And the massage parlors and hookers on the streets of used to be 'high-end' neighborhoods are exploding. No other way to make a living."</p>

<p>"During a conversation on prepping, someone recently said to me, 'If things get half as bad as these preppers think they will, I don't want to be alive.' So, how bad will things will get? Real unemployment is already at Great Depression levels (John Williams' Shadow Statistics contradicts the BLS' bogus figures), but when this depression deepens, I think we'll be looking at 50% or 60% unemployment easily. Much worse than the 1930s. It will be absolute hell for millions of Americans, and when the money stops flowing down to the man on the street, the blood will flow in the streets (Gerald Celente). Lots of it."</p>

<p>It is really easy to start printing money, but it is incredibly hard to stop.  Like any addict, the Fed is promising that they can quit at any time, but this month they refused to even start tapering their money printing a little bit.  The behavior of the Fed is so shameful that even <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101049985">CNBC</a> is comparing it to a drug addict at this point...</p>
<blockquote><p>The danger with addictions is they tend to become increasingly compulsive. That might be one moral of this week's events.</p>
<p>A few days ago, expectations were sky-high that the Federal Reserve was about to reduce its current $85 billion monthly bond purchases. But then the Fed blinked, partly because it is worried that markets have already over-reacted to the mere thought of a policy shift.</p>
<p>Faced with a choice of curbing the addiction or providing more hits of the QE drug, in other words, it chose the latter.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why won't the Fed cut back on the reckless money printing?</p>
<p>Well, as <a href="http://www.europac.net/commentaries/taper_wasnt">Peter Schiff</a> recently noted, Fed officials seem to be convinced that any "tapering" could result in the bursting of the massive financial bubbles that they have created...</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed understands, as the market seems not to, that the current "recovery" could not survive without continuation of massive monetary stimulus. Mainstream economists have mistaken the symptoms of the Fed's monetary expansion, most notably rising stock and real estate prices, as signs of real and sustainable growth. But the current asset price bubbles have nothing to do with the real economy. To the contrary, they are setting up for a painful correction that will likely be worse than the one we experienced five years ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I have written about <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/25-fast-facts-about-the-federal-reserve-please-share-with-everyone-you-know">previously</a>, the Federal Reserve is usually very careful not to do anything which will hurt the short-term interests of the financial markets and the big banks.</p>
<p>But at this point the Fed is caught in a trap.  If it continues to pump, the financial bubbles that it has created will get even worse.  If it stops, those bubbles will burst.  But as <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101048439">Doug Kass</a> noted recently, it is inevitable that these financial bubbles will burst at some point one way or another...</p>
<blockquote><p>"Getting in was easy. Getting out—not so much. The Fed is trapped and can't end tapering or else the bond and stock markets will blow up. The longer this continues the bigger the inevitable burst."</p></blockquote>
<p>In essence, we can have disaster now or disaster later.</p>
<p>But most Americans don't care much about what is happening on Wall Street.  They just want economic conditions to get better for them and for those around them.  And to this day, the mainstream media continues to sell quantitative easing to the American people as an "economic stimulus" program by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>So has quantitative easing actually been good for the U.S. economy?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>For example, while the Fed has been recklessly printing money out of thin air, household incomes have actually been going down <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/median-household-income-has-fallen-for-five-years-in-a-row">for five years in a row</a>...</p>
<p><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/quantitative-easing-worked-for-the-weimar-republic-for-a-little-while-too/real-median-household-income" rel="attachment wp-att-6440"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6440" alt="Real Median Household Income" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Real-Median-Household-Income-425x255.png" width="425" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>What about employment?</p>
<p>Don't more Americans have jobs now?</p>
<p>Actually, that is not the case at all.  Posted below is a chart that shows how the percentage of working age Americans with a job has changed since the year 2000.  As you can see, the employment to population ratio fell from about 63 percent before the last recession down to underneath 59 percent at the end of 2009 <strong>and it has stayed there ever since</strong>...</p>
<p><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/quantitative-easing-worked-for-the-weimar-republic-for-a-little-while-too/employment-population-ratio-2013-10" rel="attachment wp-att-6441"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6441" alt="Employment-Population Ratio 2013" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Employment-Population-Ratio-20131-425x255.png" width="425" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>So where is the "employment recovery"?</p>
<p>Can you point it out to me?  Because I have been staring at this chart for a long time and I still can't find it.</p>
<p>So if quantitative easing has not been good for average Americans, who has it been good for?</p>
<p>The wealthy, of course.</p>
<p>Just check out what billionaire hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101046937">told CNBC</a> about quantitative easing the other day...</p>
<blockquote><p>"<strong>This is fantastic for every rich person</strong>," he said Thursday, a day after the Fed's stunning decision to delay tightening its monetary policy. "<strong>This is the biggest redistribution of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the rich ever.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Who owns assets—the rich, the billionaires. You think Warren Buffett hates this stuff? You think I hate this stuff? I had a very good day yesterday."</p>
<p>Druckenmiller, whose net worth is estimated at more than $2 billion, said that the implication of the Fed's policy is that the rich will spend their wealth and create jobs—essentially betting on "trickle-down economics."</p>
<p>"I mean, maybe this trickle-down monetary policy that gives money to billionaires and hopefully we go spend it is going to work," he said. "But it hasn't worked for five years."</p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, Druckenmiller is exactly correct.</p>
<p>Since the end of the last recession, the Dow has been on an unprecedented tear...</p>
<p><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/quantitative-easing-worked-for-the-weimar-republic-for-a-little-while-too/dow-jones-industrial-average" rel="attachment wp-att-6442"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6442" alt="Dow Jones Industrial Average" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average-425x255.png" width="425" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>Of course these stock prices have nothing to do with economic reality at this point, but for the moment those that are making giant piles of cash on Wall Street don't really care.</p>
<p>Sadly, what very few people seem to understand is that what the Fed is doing is going to absolutely destroy confidence in our currency and in our financial system in the long-term.  Yeah, many investors have been raking in huge gobs of cash right now, but in the long run this is going to be bad <strong>for everybody</strong>.</p>
<p>We have now entered a money printing spiral from which there is no easy exit.  According to <a href="http://gainspainscapital.com/2013/09/19/the-fed-is-already-in-the-end-game/">Graham Summers</a>, the Fed has "crossed the Rubicon" and we are now "in the End Game"...</p>
<blockquote><p>If tapering even $10-15 billion per month from $85 billion month QE programs would <em>damage</em> the economy, then we’re all up you know what creek without a paddle.</p>
<p>Put it this way… here we are, five years after 2008, and the Fed is stating point blank that the economy would absolutely collapse if it spent any less than $85 billion per month. This admission has proven just how long ago we crossed the Rubicon. We’re already in the End Game. Period.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most Americans don't really understand what quantitative easing is, and most don't really try to understand it because "quantitative easing" sounds very complicated.</p>
<p>But it really isn't that complicated.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve is creating gigantic mountains of money out of thin air every month, and the Fed is using all of that newly created money to buy government debt and mortgage-backed securities.  Over the past several years, the value of the financial securities that the Fed has accumulated is greater than the total amount of publicly held debt that the U.S. government accumulated <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/339t-quantitative-explosion-fed-owns-more-treasuries-and-mbs-publicly">from the presidency of George Washington though the end of the presidency of Bill Clinton</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>The same day that the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee announced last week that the Fed would continue to buy $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and $45 billion in U.S. Treasury securities per month, the Fed also released its latest weekly accounting sheet indicating that it had already accumulated more Treasuries and MBS than the total value of the publicly held U.S. government debt amassed by all U.S. presidents from George Washington though Bill Clinton.</p></blockquote>
<p>To say that this is a desperate move by the Fed would be a massive understatement.  We have never seen anything like this before in U.S. history.</p>
<p>And look at what all of this wild money printing has done to our money supply...</p>
<p><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/quantitative-easing-worked-for-the-weimar-republic-for-a-little-while-too/m1-money-supply-2" rel="attachment wp-att-6443"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6443" alt="M1 Money Supply" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M1-Money-Supply-425x255.png" width="425" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>In many ways, the chart above is reminiscent of what the Weimar Republic did during the early years of their hyperinflationary spiral...</p>
<p><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/quantitative-easing-worked-for-the-weimar-republic-for-a-little-while-too/hyperinflation-weimar-republic-4" rel="attachment wp-att-6444"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6444" alt="Hyperinflation Weimar Republic" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Hyperinflation-Weimar-Republic-425x531.jpg" width="425" height="531" /></a></p>
<p>Just like the Weimar Republic, our money supply is beginning to grow at an exponential pace.</p>
<p>So far, complete and total disaster has not struck, so most people think that everything must be okay.</p>
<p>But it is not.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/the-greatest-debt-crisis-the-world-has-ever-seen-is-coming">previous article</a>, I included an outstanding illustration from <a title="Simon Black" href="http://www.sovereignman.com/finance/what-time-would-you-leave-12728/" target="_blank">Simon Black</a> that I think would be extremely helpful here as well…</p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s say you’re at a party in a small apartment that’s about 500 square feet in size. Then suddenly, at 11pm, a pipe bursts, starting a trickle into the living room.</p>
<p>Aside from the petty annoyance, would you feel like you were in danger? Probably not. This is a linear problem– the rate at which the water is leaking is more or less constant, so the guests can keep partying through the night without worry.</p>
<p>But let’s assume that it’s an exponential leak.</p>
<p>At first, there’s just one drop of water. But each minute, the rate doubles. So by 11:01pm, there’s 2 drops. By 11:02, 4 drops. And so forth.</p>
<p>By 11:27pm, there’s only six inches of standing water. Yet by 11:31pm, just four minutes later,<strong> the entire room is under nearly 8 feet of water. And the party’s over.</strong></p>
<p>For nearly half an hour, it all seemed safe and manageable. <strong>People had all the time in the world to leave, right up until the bitter end.</strong> 11:27, 11:28, 11:29. Then it all went from benign to deadly in a matter of minutes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are you starting to get the picture?</p>
<p>What the Federal Reserve is doing is systematically destroying the U.S. dollar, and the rest of the world is starting to take notice.</p>
<p>Why should they continue to lend us trillions of dollars at super low interest rates when we are exploding the size of our money supply?</p>
<p>It is simply not rational for other nations to continue to lend us money at less than 3 percent a year when the real rate of inflation is somewhere <a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts">around 8 to 10 percent</a> and reckless money printing by the Fed threatens to greatly accelerate the devaluation of our currency.</p>
<p>When QE first started, the added demand for U.S. government debt by the Federal Reserve helped drive long-term interest rates down to record low levels.</p>
<p>But in the long-term, the only rational response by all other buyers of U.S. government debt will be to demand a much higher rate of return because of the rapid devaluation of U.S. currency.</p>
<p>So QE drives down long-term interest rates in the short-term, but in the long-term the only rational direction for long-term interest rates to go is much, much higher and in recent months we have already started to see this.</p>
<p>The only way that the Fed can stop this is by increasing the amount of quantitative easing.</p>
<p>Right now, the Fed is buying roughly half a trillion dollars worth of U.S. Treasuries a year, but the U.S. government issues close to a trillion dollars of new debt and must roll over about 3 trillion dollars of existing debt each year.</p>
<p>If the Federal Reserve eventually decides to buy <strong>all of the debt</strong>, then interest rates won't be a major problem.  But if the Fed goes that far our financial system would be regarded as a total joke by the remainder of the globe and we would reach hyperinflation much more rapidly.</p>
<p>If the Federal Reserve stops buying debt completely, the financial bubbles that they have created will burst and we will rapidly be facing a financial crisis even worse than what we experienced back in 2008.</p>
<p>But almost whatever the Fed does at this point, the rest of the world will probably continue to start to move away from the U.S. dollar as the de facto reserve currency of the planet.  This move is just beginning, but it is going to have <strong>major implications</strong> for us in the years ahead.  This is a topic that I will be addressing extensively in future articles.</p>
<p>Most of the debate about quantitative easing has focused on the impact that it will have on the U.S. economy in the short-term.</p>
<p>That is a huge mistake.</p>
<p>Of much greatest importance is what quantitative easing means for the long-term.</p>
<p>The rest of the world is losing confidence in the U.S. dollar and in U.S. debt because of the reckless money printing that the Fed has been doing.</p>
<p>But we desperately need the rest of the world to use "the petrodollar" and to lend us the money that we need to pay our bills.</p>
<p>As the rest of the planet starts to reject the U.S. dollar and starts to demand a much higher rate of return to lend us money, the U.S. economy is going to experience a tremendous amount of pain.</p>
<p>It is hard to put into words how foolish the Federal Reserve has been.  The Fed is systematically destroying what was once the strongest financial system in the world, and in the end we are all going to pay the price.</p>

<p>Ever since the financial crisis of 2008, our politicians have been running around proclaiming that they will not rest until they have fixed "the too big to fail problem", but instead of fixing it those banks have rapidly gotten even larger.  Just check out the following figures which come from <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-too-big-to-fail-20130917,0,510435.story">the Los Angeles Times</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>Just before the financial crisis hit, <span class="taxInlineTagLink">Wells Fargo</span> &amp; Co. had $609 billion in assets. Now it has $1.4 trillion. <span class="taxInlineTagLink">Bank of America Corp.</span> had $1.7 trillion in assets. That's up to $2.1 trillion.</p>
<p>And the assets of <span class="taxInlineTagLink">JPMorgan Chase</span> &amp; Co., the nation's biggest bank, have ballooned to $2.4 trillion from $1.8 trillion.</p></blockquote>
<p>We are witnessing a consolidation of the banking industry that is absolutely stunning.  Hundreds of smaller banks have been swallowed up by these behemoths, and millions of Americans are finding that they have to deal with these banking giants whether they like it or not.</p>
<p>Even though all they do is move money around, these banks have become the core of our economic system, and they are growing at an astounding pace.  The following numbers come from a recent <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2013/09/13/too-big-to-fail-banks/">CNN article</a>...</p>
<p>-The assets of the six largest banks in the United States have grown <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2013/09/13/too-big-to-fail-banks/">by 37 percent</a> over the past five years.</p>
<p>-The U.S. banking system has 14.4 trillion dollars in total assets.  The six largest banks now account for <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2013/09/13/too-big-to-fail-banks/">67 percent</a> of those assets and the other 6,934 banks account for only <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2013/09/13/too-big-to-fail-banks/">33 percent</a> of those assets.</p>
<p>-Approximately <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2013/09/13/too-big-to-fail-banks/">1,400 smaller banks</a> have disappeared over the past five years.</p>
<p>-JPMorgan Chase is roughly the size of the entire British economy.</p>
<p>-The four largest banks have <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2013/09/13/too-big-to-fail-banks/">more than a million employees</a> combined.</p>
<p>-The five largest banks account for <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2013/09/13/too-big-to-fail-banks/">42 percent</a> of all loans in the United States.</p>
<p>As I discussed above, without these giant banks <strong>there is no economy</strong>.  We should have never, ever allowed this to happen, but now that it has happened it is imperative that the American people understand this.  The power of these banks is <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2013/09/13/too-big-to-fail-banks/">absolutely overwhelming</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>One third of all business loans this year were made by Bank of America. Wells Fargo funds nearly a quarter of all mortgage loans. And held in the vaults of JPMorgan Chase is $1.3 trillion, which is 12% of our collective cash, including the payrolls of many thousands of companies, or enough to buy 47,636,496,885 of <a href="http://www.walmart.com/ip/20679803?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;adid=22222222227015503129&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=30081124750&amp;wl4=&amp;wl5=pla&amp;wl6=40011770350&amp;veh=sem" target="new" rel="external nofollow">these</a> NFL branded toaster ovens. Thanks for your business!</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of people tend to focus on many of the other threats to our economy, but the number one potential threat that our economy is facing is the potential failure of the too big to fail banks.  As we saw in 2008, when they start to fail things can get really bad really fast.</p>
<p>And as I have written about <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/tag/derivatives">so many times</a>, the number one threat to the too big to fail banks is the possibility of a derivatives crisis.</p>
<p>Former Goldman Sachs banker and best selling author Nomi Prins recently <a href="http://usawatchdog.com/nomi-prins-war-could-implode-financial-system-starting-with-derivatives/">told Greg Hunter of USAWatchdog.com</a> that the global economy "could implode and have serious ramifications on the financial systems starting with derivatives and working on outward." You can watch the full video of that interview <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adb9owB4pxs">right here</a>.</p>
<p>And Nomi Prins is exactly right.  Just like we witnessed in 2008, a derivatives panic can spiral out of control very quickly.  Our big banks should have learned a lesson from 2008 and should have greatly scaled back their reckless betting.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that has not happened.  In fact, according to the OCC's <a href="http://www.occ.gov/topics/capital-markets/financial-markets/trading/derivatives/dq113.pdf">latest quarterly report</a> on bank trading and derivatives activities, the big banks have become even more reckless since <a title="The Coming Derivatives Panic That Will Destroy Global Financial Markets" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-coming-derivatives-panic-that-will-destroy-global-financial-markets">the last time I reported on this</a>.  The following figures reflect the new information contained in the latest OCC report...</p>
<p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong></p>
<p>Total Assets: $1,948,150,000,000 (just over 1.9 trillion dollars)</p>
<p>Total Exposure To Derivatives: $70,287,894,000,000 (more than 70 trillion dollars)</p>
<p><strong>Citibank</strong></p>
<p>Total Assets: $1,306,258,000,000 (a bit more than 1.3 trillion dollars)</p>
<p>Total Exposure To Derivatives: $58,471,038,000,000 (more than 58 trillion dollars)</p>
<p><strong>Bank Of America</strong></p>
<p>Total Assets: $1,458,091,000,000 (a bit more than 1.4 trillion dollars)</p>
<p>Total Exposure To Derivatives: $44,543,003,000,000 (more than 44 trillion dollars)</p>
<p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong></p>
<p>Total Assets: $113,743,000,000 (a bit more than 113 billion dollars - yes, you read that correctly)</p>
<p>Total Exposure To Derivatives: $42,251,600,000,000 (more than 42 trillion dollars)</p>
<p>That means that the total exposure that Goldman Sachs has to derivatives contracts is <strong>more than 371 times greater</strong> than their total assets.</p>
<p>How in the world can anyone say that Goldman Sachs is not being incredibly reckless?</p>
<p>And remember, the overwhelming majority of these derivatives contracts <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-441-trillion-dollar-interest-rate-derivative-timb-bomb">are interest rate derivatives</a>.</p>
<p>Wild swings in interest rates could set off this time bomb and send our entire financial system plunging into chaos.</p>
<p>After climbing rapidly for a couple of months, the yield on 10 year U.S. Treasury bonds has stabilized for the moment.</p>
<p>But if that changes and interest rates start going up dramatically again, that is going to be a huge problem for these too big to fail banks.</p>
<p>And I know that a lot of you don't have much sympathy for the big banks, but remember, if they go down we go down too.</p>
<p>These banks have been unbelievably reckless, but when they fail, we will all pay the price.</p>

<p>Sadly, Yellen is not a woman that believes in free markets.  She had the following to say <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/16/janet-yellen-fed_n_3934989.html?ref=topbar">back in 1999</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>"Will capitalist economies operate at full employment in the absence of routine intervention? Certainly not."</p></blockquote>
<p>Yellen believes that without the "routine intervention" of the central planners at the Fed, our economy will not produce satisfactory results.</p>
<p>So if you thought that Bernanke was an "interventionist", you haven't seen anything yet.  In fact, according to <a href="http://business.time.com/2013/09/16/5-things-everybody-should-know-about-janet-yellen/">Time Magazine</a>, Yellen was continually urging Bernanke to do even more "to help stimulate the economy"...</p>
<blockquote><p>But as the most recent financial crisis proved, a good Fed chief needs to be willing to think outside the box to achieve its goals of low, steady inflation and full employment. This is exactly what Bernanke did — using the powers of his office to launch a massive bond-buying program aimed at lowering interest rates further down the yield curve and promising to keep short-term interest rates at near zero for years. Bernanke, however, didn’t launch these programs immediately. Behind the scenes, it was <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323551004578441331455504010.html">reportedly Yellen</a> who was the most forceful advocate for the Fed doing more to help stimulate the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is truly frightening to think that Yellen might turn out to be "Bernanke on steroids".</p>
<p>Let's hope that she is not the choice.</p>
<p>But the media is endlessly hyping her.  They keep proclaiming that she has a "<a href="http://business.time.com/2013/09/16/5-things-everybody-should-know-about-janet-yellen/">good track record</a>" when it comes to forecasting future economic conditions.</p>
<p>Oh really?</p>
<p>Back <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2013/09/the-truth-about-janet-yellens-forecast.html">in February 2007</a>, before the housing crash and the last financial crisis, she made the following statement...</p>
<blockquote><p>"The bottom line for housing is that the concerns we used to hear about the possibility of a devastating collapse—one that might be big enough to cause a recession in the U.S. economy—while not fully allayed have diminished. Moreover, while the future for housing activity remains uncertain, I think there is a reasonable chance that housing is in the process of stabilizing, which would mean that it would put a considerably smaller drag on the economy going forward."</p></blockquote>
<p>And during a speech <a href="http://www.frbsf.org/our-district/press/presidents-speeches/yellen-speeches/2007/december/the-us-economy-and-monetary-policy-seattle/">in December 2007</a> she offered up this gem...</p>
<blockquote><p>"To sum up the story on the outlook for real GDP growth, my own view is that, under appropriate monetary policy, the economy is still likely to achieve a relatively smooth adjustment path, with real GDP growth gradually returning to its roughly 2½ percent trend over the next year or so, and the unemployment rate rising only very gradually to just above its 4¾ percent sustainable level."</p></blockquote>
<p>And in front of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2013/09/janet-yellen-on-financial-crisis-i.html">in 2010</a> she openly admitted that she did not see the last financial crisis coming...</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="font-family: inherit;">“For my own part,” Ms. Yellen said, “I did not see and did not appreciate what the risks were with securitization, the credit ratings agencies, the shadow banking system, the S.I.V.’s — I didn’t see any of that coming until it happened.”</span></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So if she didn't see the last crisis coming, will she see the next one coming?</p>
<p>Right now, she insists that everything is going to be just fine in our immediate future.</p>
<p>Do you believe her?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, economic warning flags are popping up all over the place.  As <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-09-16/sub-2-tipping-point-economy">Zero Hedge</a> recently noted, perhaps this is why a lot of high profile candidates don't want the Fed job.  Perhaps they don't want to be blamed for the giant economic mess that is about to happen...</p>
<blockquote><p>With so many candidates dropping out of the race, one has to wonder why the attraction of the 'most-powerful' job in the world is fading. Perhaps it is not wanting to stuck between the rock of the 'broken-market-diminishing-returns' of moar QE and the hard place of an economy/market that is sputtering and needs moar. As Bloomberg's Rich Yamarone notes, There’s a little known rule of thumb in the economics world: <strong>when the annual growth rate of key U.S. indicators falls below 2 percent, the economy slides into recession in the next 12 months... and more than one of them is flashing red</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>But we have far bigger worries on our hands than just another recession.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, Fed intervention has been systematically destroying confidence in the U.S. dollar and has been making U.S. government debt less desirable.  Foreigners are already starting to dump U.S. debt, and it is only a matter of time before the U.S. dollar loses its status as the de facto reserve currency of the world.</p>
<p>By "kicking the can down the road", the Fed has created tremendous structural problems which are going to come back to bite us big time in the long run.</p>
<p>Recklessly printing money, monetizing debt and driving interest rates down to ridiculously low levels may have had some benefits in the short-term, but in the end this <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-biggest-ponzi-scheme-in-the-history-of-the-world">giant Ponzi scheme</a> is going to collapse in spectacular fashion.  The following is how <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-09-16/guest-post-reality-breathing-down-bernankes-neck">James Howard Kunstler</a> puts it...</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 100%;"><strong> The Fed can only pretend to try to get out of this self-created hell-hole. </strong>The stock market is a proxy for the economy and a handful of giant banks are proxies for the American public, and all they’ve really got going is a hideous high-frequency churn of trades in conjectural debentures that pretend to represent something hidden in the caboose of a choo-choo train of wished-for value — and hardly anyone in the nation, including those with multiple graduate degrees in abstruse crypto-sciences, can even pretend to understand it all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 100%;"><strong>When reality crosses the finish line ahead of poor, exhausted Mr. Bernanke, havoc must ensue. </strong>All the artificial props fall away and the so-called American economy is revealed for what it is: a surreal landscape of ruin with nothing left but salvage value. Very few people will get a living off of the salvage operations, and there will be fights and skirmishes everywhere by one gang or another for control of the pickings. The utility of money itself may be bygone, along with the legitimacy of anyone or anything claiming institutional authority. This is what comes of all attempts to get something for nothing.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The American people deserve to know the truth.</p>
<p>The Fed is not our "savior".  The truth is that the Fed is the primary cause of many of our biggest economic problems.  For much more on this, please see my previous article entitled "<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/25-fast-facts-about-the-federal-reserve-please-share-with-everyone-you-know">25 Fast Facts About The Federal Reserve – Please Share With Everyone You Know</a>".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Wall Street and the mainstream media love the Fed and they appear to very much love Janet Yellen.</p>
<p>Yellen would be an absolutely horrifying choice for Fed Chairman, but so would any of the other names that have been floated.</p>
<p>America has embraced the foolishness of the financial central planners at the Federal Reserve, and in the end we will all pay a great price for that.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p60-245.pdf">the Census report</a>, the high point for median household income in the United States was back in 1999 ($56,080).  It almost got back to that level in 2007 ($55,627), but ever since then there has been a steady decline.  The following figures come directly <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p60-245.pdf">from the report</a>, and as you can see, median household income has fallen every single year for the past five years...</p>
<p>2007: $55,627</p>
<p>2008: $53,644</p>
<p>2009: $53,285</p>
<p>2010: $51,892</p>
<p>2011: $51,100</p>
<p>2012: $51,017</p>
<p>How far does that number have to go down before we admit that we have a major problem on our hands?</p>
<p>The new Census report also revealed that 46.5 million Americans are living in poverty.  As <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/census-obama-s-1st-term-real-median-income-down-2627-people-poverty">CNSNews.com</a> noted, this is far higher than when Barack Obama first entered the White House...</p>
<blockquote><p>During the four years that marked President Barack Obama’s first term in office, the real median income of American households dropped by $2,627 and the number of people on poverty increased by approximately 6,667,000, according to <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p60-245.pdf">data released today</a> by the Census Bureau.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why does Obama <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/33-shocking-facts-which-show-how-the-u-s-economy-has-tanked-since-obama-became-president">continue to insist</a> that things are getting better?</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/23116928-20618000-households-food-stamps-now-outnumber-all-households">one out of every five</a> households in the United States is on food stamps.</p>
<p>One out of every five.</p>
<p>How bad does it have to get before we acknowledge that what we are doing economically <strong>is not working</strong>.</p>
<p>Will half of us eventually end up on food stamps?</p>
<p>In addition, the <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p60-245.pdf">new Census report</a> also says that 48 million Americans are currently without any kind of health insurance whatsoever.</p>
<p>The biggest culprit for this is the stunning decline of employment-based health insurance.  Back in 1999, <a title="64.1 percent" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/poverty-in-america-2012-9#people-by-type-of-health-insurance-coverage-1999-to-2011-11" target="_blank">64.1 percent</a> of all Americans were covered by employment-based health insurance.  Today, only <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/17/news/economy/health-insurance-census/index.html?iid=HP_LN">54.9 percent</a> are covered by employment-based health insurance.</p>
<p>And of course as I noted <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/percentage-of-americans-that-consider-themselves-to-be-lower-class-is-at-an-all-time-high">yesterday</a>, even more companies are going to be dumping health insurance plans because of Obamacare.</p>
<p>All in all, what we have been witnessing over the past decade and a half is <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/they-denied-that-we-were-in-a-depression-in-1933-and-they-are-doing-it-again-in-2013">the systematic evisceration of the middle class</a>.</p>
<p>After accounting for inflation, right now 40 percent of all U.S. workers are making less than <a title="what a full-time minimum wage worker made back in 1968" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/40-percent-of-u-s-workers-make-less-than-what-a-full-time-minimum-wage-worker-made-in-1968">what a full-time minimum wage worker made back in 1968</a>.</p>
<p>Over the years, our incomes have certainly gone up, but inflation has increased even faster.</p>
<p>Back when I was growing up, $50,000 a year sounded like a whole lot of money.  I thought that anyone should be able to live a very comfortable lifestyle on that amount of money.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, $50,000 a year doesn't go nearly as far as it once did.</p>
<p>If you take the current median household income ($51,017) and divide it up by 12 months, it comes to just a little bit more than $4000 a month.</p>
<p>And as I noted <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/things-are-getting-worse-median-household-income-has-fallen-4-years-in-a-row">last year</a>, it is not easy for the average American family to do everything that it needs to do on $4000 a month...</p>
<blockquote><p>So can an average family of four people make it on just $4000 a month?</p>
<p>Well, first of all you have got to take out taxes.  After accounting for all forms of taxation you will be lucky if you have $3000 remaining.</p>
<p>With that $3000, you have to pay for all of the following...</p>
<p>*Housing</p>
<p>*Power</p>
<p>*Water</p>
<p>*Food</p>
<p>*Phone</p>
<p>*Internet</p>
<p>*At Least One Vehicle</p>
<p>*Gasoline</p>
<p>*Vehicle Repairs</p>
<p>*Car Insurance</p>
<p>*Health Insurance</p>
<p>*Dental Bills</p>
<p>*Home Or Rental Insurance</p>
<p>*Life Insurance</p>
<p>*Student Loan Debt Payments</p>
<p>*Credit Card Payments</p>
<p>*Furniture</p>
<p>*Clothing</p>
<p>*Pets</p>
<p>*Entertainment (although it is hard to imagine any money will be left for that)</p>
<p>Have I left anything out?</p>
<p>The truth is that $3000 does not go as far as it used to.</p>
<p>No wonder American families are feeling so stretched financially these days.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p60-245.pdf">new Census report</a> also noted that the gap between the wealthiest Americans and the rest of us continues to grow.  There is certainly nothing wrong with making money, but if the economy was working properly all Americans should be able to have the opportunity to better themselves.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101038089">CNBC</a>, the 400 wealthiest Americans now have more money than the poorest 50 percent of all Americans combined.</p>
<p>So why is this happening?  Well, certainly there are a lot of reasons, but in recent years quantitative easing has definitely played a role.  As I noted in my recent article <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/25-fast-facts-about-the-federal-reserve-please-share-with-everyone-you-know">about the Federal Reserve</a>, quantitative easing has been <strong>incredibly good</strong> for those with stocks and other forms of financial investments.  All of that liquidity has juiced the financial markets, and the extremely wealthy have been loving it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, things just continue to get even tougher for most of the rest of the American people, and the frightening thing is that the next major wave of the economic collapse has not even hit us yet.</p>
<p>How bad will things be for average American families once that happens?</p>
<p>And there are certainly lots of troubling signs as we get ready to head into the fall season...</p>
<p>-Total mortgage activity has dropped to the lowest level that we have seen <a title="since October 2008" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/prepare-for-tough-times-if-your-job-has-anything-to-do-with-real-estate-or-mortgages">since October 2008</a>.</p>
<p>-One of the largest furniture manufacturers in America <a title="was just forced into bankruptcy" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/09/09/furniture-brands-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy/2790369/" target="_blank">was just forced into bankruptcy</a>.</p>
<p>-According to the Wall Street Journal, the 2013 holiday shopping season is already being projected to be the worst that we have seen <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-09-17/holiday-shopping-season-set-worst-2009">since 2009</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully the slow and steady economic decline that we have been experiencing will not accelerate into a full-blown avalanche any time soon.</p>
<p>But I would definitely get prepared just in case.</p>

<p>When I mentioned above that "less people then ever believe that they have the opportunity to make a better life for themselves", perhaps you doubted that statement.</p>
<p>And I wish that it was not true.</p>
<p>But according to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-lower-class-20130916,0,5616335.story">the Los Angeles Times</a>, that is exactly what one new survey shows...</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year, less than 55% of Americans agreed that "people like me and my family have a good chance of improving our standard of living," the lowest level since the General Social Survey first asked the question in 1987.</p></blockquote>
<p>And even those that are "educated" are becoming more pessimistic...</p>
<blockquote><p>From 2002 to 2012, the "lower class" among Americans with one to four years of college more than doubled — from 2.6% to 5.8%.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what about you?</p>
<p>Would you describe yourself as "lower class"?</p>
<p>Not that there is anything wrong with that.  It can be very hard to be optimistic about your economic situation when you are trapped in poverty and everyone around you is trapped in poverty.</p>
<p>Even as <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/33-shocking-facts-which-show-how-the-u-s-economy-has-tanked-since-obama-became-president">Barack Obama</a> boldly proclaims that we are in the midst of an "economic recovery", poverty continues to grow.  <a href="http://endtimeheadlines.wordpress.com/2013/09/16/poverty-in-n-j-reaches-52-year-high/">In New Jersey</a>, poverty hit a 52-year high in 2011, and when the final numbers for 2012 come out it is anticipated that they will be even worse...</p>
<blockquote><p>Poverty in New Jersey continued to grow even as the national recession lifted, reaching a 52-year high in 2011, according to a report released today. The annual survey by Legal Services of New Jersey found 24.7 percent of the state’s population — 2.1 million residents — was considered poor in 2011. That’s a jump of more than 80,000 people — nearly 1 percent higher than the previous year and 3.8 percent more than pre-recession levels. ”This is not just a one-year or five-year or 10-year variation,” said Melville D. Miller Jr., the president of LSNJ, which gives free legal help to low-income residents in civil cases. “This is the worst that it’s been since the 1960 Census.” And it may get worse: The report warned Census figures for 2012 to be released this month may be higher.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are two Americas today.  In the "good America", stock values are soaring and almost everyone has a job.  People from that America openly wonder <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/they-denied-that-we-were-in-a-depression-in-1933-and-they-are-doing-it-again-in-2013">why everyone is so concerned about the economy</a>.</p>
<p>In the "bad America", unemployment is rampant and poverty is everywhere.  At this point, low income households have an unemployment rate that is <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/employment-gap-rich-poor-widest-record-20265592">over 21 percent</a>, and there is not much help on the horizon.</p>
<p>In the old days, if the wealthy wanted to get wealthier, they needed the rest of us to run their businesses and work in their factories.</p>
<p>But today, they have figured out that they can make much larger profits by replacing us with computers, robots and machines.  They have also figured out that they can ship millions of our jobs to the other side of the planet where it is legal to pay slave labor wages with no benefits.</p>
<p>This is putting a huge squeeze on average American workers.  For most Americans, the only thing that they have to offer in the marketplace is their labor.  Unfortunately, that labor is not valued as much as it used to be.</p>
<p>Yes, the elite still need us to do service jobs for them.  Those are not easily replaced by technology or shipped overseas.  So they still need us to cut their hair and flip their burgers.</p>
<p>But without a doubt we have a structural problem with unemployment.  As the Brookings Institution recently discovered, <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2013/09/16/unemployment-economy-recovery/?iid=HP_River">it would take 8 million more jobs</a> before we could say that we have "recovered" from the last recession...</p>
<blockquote><p>Last month, the unemployment rate fell to 7.3% from 8.1% a year ago. That might signal progress, but the share of workers with jobs was 58.6%; it has remained close to that for several years. The unemployment rate is inherently flawed and isn't the best measure of economic progress; it counts only those with jobs or actively looking for work.</p>
<p>And in a frustratingly slow economic recovery that has discouraged countless workers, it risks ignoring these missing workers -- an estimated 6 million, according to the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project.</p>
<p>The Washington-based think tank has come up with what it calls the "jobs gap," or the number of jobs it would take to offset the effects of the Great Recession. Factoring in the millions of jobs lost during the Great Recession and the number of jobs needed to absorb new workers, the nation needs 8.3 million jobs to fully recover from the recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>And of course the quality of our jobs <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/15-signs-that-the-quality-of-jobs-in-america-is-going-downhill-really-fast">continues to decline</a> as well.  In America today, only <a title="47 percent" href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/05/only-47-americans-have-full-time-job" target="_blank">47 percent</a> of adults have a full-time job, and one out of every ten jobs is now filled <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/the-expendables-how-the-temps-who-power-corporate-giants-are-getting-crushe">by a temp agency</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, thanks to Obamacare this trend is going to get a lot worse.  Millions more Americans are going to be forced into part-time employment.  For example, just check out <a href="http://fairfaxcity.patch.com/groups/business-news/p/trader-joes-kicks-part-timers-off-healthcare-plan_a2977162">what Trader Joe's is doing</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>Trader Joe's, the grocer once lauded for providing health care coverage to its part-time workers, is about to push those employees off its plan.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/11/trader-joes-obamacare_n_3902341.html" rel="nofollow">a memo obtained by the <i>Huffington Post</i></a>, the company will stop covering employees who work less than 30 hours per week.</p>
<p>The change is set for the start of 2014. Instead of insurance, workers instead will get a check for $500 in January.<br />
<i><br />
</i>"Depending on income you may earn outside of Trader Joe's, we believe that with the $500 from Trader Joe's and the tax credits available under the [Affordable Care Act (ACA)], many of you should be able to obtain health care coverage at very little if any net cost to you," said Trader Joe CEO Dan Bane in the memo.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wish that there was better news to report, but we have to be very honest about where we are at as a nation.</p>
<p>In order for there to be a thriving "middle class", there needs to be lots of middle class jobs.</p>
<p>Sadly, the number of breadwinner jobs that the middle class depends upon <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-decline-of-breadwinner-jobs-has-resulted-in-the-longest-bread-lines-in-american-history">is shrinking</a>.</p>
<p>Unless a miracle happens, the percentage of Americans that consider themselves to be "lower class" is probably going to continue to grow.</p>
<p>So how would you solve this problem?</p>
